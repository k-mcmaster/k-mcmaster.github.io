    "Fans are often known for using their talents and dedication to create new media based on the things they enjoy. One of the best examples of this is the writing and reading of fanfiction, the practice in which amateur authors may take aspects from the original content that they enjoyed and transforming them into original works of their own creation. There are various methods that these authors use to share their works with other individuals who also enjoyed the original piece of media but one of the most common is to post the work to a dedicated site for the posting and reading of fanfiction. While there are quite a few options available, we'll be focusing on Archive of Our Own, known colloquially as AO3, for our purposes as AO3's built in tagging and data storage system will allow us to search through the works of fiction using the author's own tags for their work rather than attempting to create tags ourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, since AO3 currently has over nine million works, in order to better analyze the data associated with the site and trends of fanfiction authors, we'll be focusing on writings by fans of a specific piece of media: the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling. Additionally, we'll be specifically be focusing on the fanfiction written around a specific date in time as there are over 300,000 works for that series alone. \n",

    "On June 6th of 2020, author J.K. Rowling took to Twitter to express her displeasure over the use of the phrase \"people who menstruate\" rather than the word women. This tweet and the subsequent tweets that followed it came under a lot of backlash with trans activists and fans of the Harry Potter series. This was not the first time that author J.K. Rowling had expressed such views and received backlash, but it is one of the most notable, so we will be aanalyzing works of fanfiction posted onto AO3 for the month before the tweet was made and the month following the tweet to view the potential impact that Rowling's postings may have had on the writings of the LGBTQIA+ community members and their allies.
