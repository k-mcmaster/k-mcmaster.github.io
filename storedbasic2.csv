 “'Some speak of a ring,’” Mr. Weasley began, “‘that lies nestled on a dark, crumbling twig in a clearing in the woods. The woods are dark, unforgiving, and many are warned against going within the trees―some might even say it's forbidden,’” He winked at Harry then, who couldn’t help but roll his eyes. 
“So, it’s a fairy tale about the Forbidden Forest.” 
“Yes, I suppose so,” Said Mr. Weasley, and straightened with a slight wince to tell him firmly, “and I know you’ve got a history of tromping around in there, so I’m telling you now,  do not go back in there to look for rings. Bad idea.” 
Stories are just stories—nothing more, nothing less. Morals and lessons can be gleaned by parables and fables alike, but the truth of it is so. That’s what people believe, at least. And that’s exactly what makes them so dangerous.There's a grain of truth in every tale. Harry learns this the hard way when a fairy tale Arthur tells him comes to life, and he’s forced to abandon the wizarding world at the worst possible time—by winding up stuck in 1942 for six months. 
Believe it or not, being Tom Riddle's unwitting roommate isn't even the worst part of it.

The headsman grips Harry’s thin shoulder with his heavy hand; he shoves Harry to his knees. With a shuddering breath, Harry leans forward over the block. The scent of blood and wet dirt fills his mouth. He turns his head. He wants to see the sky when he goes.Instead, he sees—A dark shape blots out the sun, and a shadow falls over Helgen. Another cry splits the air, so loud he feels it in his bones, in his throat. The earth shatters around him.A shout—words he feels but doesn’t know, not yet—and all he sees is fire.

[Excerpt:] Eleven schools struck me as very little and homeschooling is all well and good, but where does that leave the muggleborns? Would they constantly break the statute of secrecy because their magic is through no fault of their own untrained? How many muggleborns are there anyways? For that matter, how many witches and wizards are there? I set out to discover the answers to these questions, through math and logic and the liberal application of google to the problem. Allow me to take you along on this journey, on which I discovered what I like to call: The Trouble With JKR’s Math.

Presumed dead from the moment she was born, Katrina Potter has led a sheltered life, hidden away from the wizarding world for her own safety. Upon Voldemort's return, she is thrust back into the world that for years, she was forced to learn about from her books and through staring out her bedroom window. With so many questions swirling around her supposed return from the dead, she finds herself under an even harsher spotlight than her brother, a constant subject of scrutiny by the Ministry and her peers. Under threat of an impending war, Katrina adjusts to her new reality, while protecting her brother from those who mock him, including a certain blonde Slytherin, and his own stubbornness, and unbeknownst to them, she could be the key to tipping the war in favor of the light or the dark.

Inside, Hermione bypassed the wooden desk at the front completely and led me toward the back of the small shop. The walls held framed prints of tattoos, some still and some clearly magical. My eyes fixed on an inked serpent peering up between two scandalously naked breasts, tongue flickering out intermittently. “Are you sure we’re supposed to just walk right in?” Was artwork like this even allowed on Diagon Alley? This felt more like Knockturn.“Yes, they’re expecting us.” She paused outside the door. “Now, listen. I’d like you to keep an open mind about the tattoo artist and not react…hastily.”“Oi, bring him in already!” The unmistakable voice of Ron Weasley cut through the door.Hermione intertwined her fingers with mine before I could escape.

Surely, any wizard who knows pureblood circles, knows you’re nothing to someone unless you can name their second cousin three times removed, as well as know exactly who in their family not to mention at dinner. Who was this Dark Lord’s second cousin three times removed? And why was he clearly not mentioning any of his family at dinner?Regulus realises he might have found a way to make the idea of his joining the Dark Lord as repugnant to his fanatical pureblood mother as it is to him. Unfortunately, especially when it comes to avoiding a war, we often meet our fate on the road we take to avoid it.

Voldemort was one of the most famous and earliest artists from the Renaissance Era and arguably the most famous English one. He painted, sculpted countless statues for the public, royalty, and nobles alike.His most famous painting wasn’t a commission nor a piece that he had planned to make money off. It went under the name “The Potterer”, presumably the last painting (and the best work) of Voldemort. Tom Riddle, Voldemort’s last living descendant was given the responsibility to take care of the expensive paintings.AndHarry Potter… Well, Harry didn’t know why everyone kept mistaking him for the person in the painting. What was so special about it anyway? It was just a portrait of someone!

In a universe where the Ministry of Magic controls more about you, than you control about yourself. The Ministry of Magic assigns you a spouse and you're stuck with them whether you like it or not.Sirius Black openly hated Severus Snape and was not shy about the fact that he loved his best friend. When Sirius Black is presented with a marriage summons he cannot ignore, he finds out the true definition of sleeping with the enemy. 
“can seven years of good memories make up for the seven years of bad ones?” “We didn’t get married because we wanted to,” Snape says, “We got married because we had to,” Snape says. “You can have your boy apologize to my son,” Snape says firmly. Sirius watches Snape for a moment, trying not to grin, as he figures out what Snape was really saying, “Tell me,” Sirius says, sitting down on Snape’s lap. “I know,” Snape says looking back at Sirius, “but your side is outnumbered.” Leaving the thin wizard on the ground unmasked, bleeding. “I would die for our child, if it came down to it,” Snape says firmly. There was no way in hell that Sirius had just admitted to giving him a love potion.

‘Why,’ Hermione wanted to ask, after every use of her first name, and when his heated gaze lingered on her. There was nothing that she could give him aside from caring for his son, though he never treated her as a mere governess. The times that she spent with Draco, regardless of whether Tom was between them, or not were her favorite, regardless of the impossible dreams they encouraged. She knew without a doubt that she wanted to stay, though she knew that she could not if Draco took another as his mate. There were letters in her desk left unsealed and unsent, ones she intended for the Longbottoms and other neighboring families, like the Parkinson’s. All had children that she could care for, and she knew that she could work anywhere with Draco’s recommendation. The thought made her heart desperately ache, as everything within her demanded that she stay. Tom lay asleep still in her lap, reminding her of who she would abandon if she sought another position. Still...she longed to stay.Historical Werewolf AU | A certain governess and her employer pine for one another

A mysteriously faulty time-turner lands Hermione in the year 1977—right as the Marauders are starting their 7th year. With the knowledge of the fate of the world and everyone around her, Hermione feels like quite a bit of responsibility has been thrust upon her. But of course, despite having the fate of the universe in her palms, Sirius Black still somehow manages to make himself Hermione’s number one concern and priority—especially as Hermione accidentally lets on she knows entirely too much about Sirius and his friends.--here's a spotify playlist for this sin of a fic lol--april 23 2022: again on hiatus. currently working on next chapter; unsure when it'll be out. aiming for before 2 year anniversary lmao

The littlest Weasley, seventh to be born to her mother and father, was brought squealing and shrieking into a world with more brothers than anyone could ever hope for. Their cosy ramshackle home was always fit to bursting with people cooing at her, cradling her, rocking her to sleep, and her earliest years were rich with love, though unfortunately not rich with much of anything else.It was only when she was about five years old or so, that she realised there was something terribly wrong: her brothers were treating her as if she were the same as them.   title from the song ""i forget where we were"" by ben howard

Five years have passed since Draco threw Harriet Potter his wand and watched her defeat Voldemort. Since then, he's faded into obscurity, while Harry has continued to lead and grow in fame. Draco usually spends Ministry galas on his own, enjoying the view.

Shortly before Sirius Black escapes from prison, Dumbledore invited Remus Lupin to take up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor. When dementors stop the Hogwarts Express to look for the escaped fugitive, Remus does what he can to protect the students under his watch, but at the same time he can't help but remember several long ago moments in which he WAS harboring his old friend.

Grindelwald won, and the Wizarding World has been restructured. Wizards are divided into their designations of owners and pets, and then the rest who were neither. Only those who have the resources, care, and love enough to properly teach and look after a pet were granted their license of ownership. Muggle-borns, half-bloods, and Dumbledore supporting families were the pets; to be guided in the ways of the Wizarding World, to make them the best wizards they could be.Severus Snape knew he was to be a pet ever since he knew what magic was, and he wanted to be a good one too. He just hoped that Lady Magic would grant him a master that would be good to him.(Lady Magic decided to give him one that would love him too.)(Further detailed warnings in each chapter, but i'm a soft person so i write soft things, its basically just fluff and smut)

Everyone experiences feelings of yearning. Whether its an object, a person, or a specific time and place.We all yearn for something.  A yearning we often experience is nostalgia, a yearning for distorted, melancholic past of better days.(Y/N) often yearns for the past, yearning for what was once there if it was there at all. The past will never leave her, she can never forget it nor can she fully embrace it. She's a rebellious girl with a strong exterior that's endured so much, but inside there's the dark emptiness. More than once does she find herself to be a scapegoat, she does her fair share of trouble, engaging in fights to protect students from bullying. Hogwarts was the opportunity she desperately needed in her life to discovering herself, her capabilities, and newfound relationships that will include a familiar brooding boy, Severus Snape, and werewolf Remus Lupin.

He had thought it was the end of the line for him. He was dead on the battlefield, and for some odd reason, he couldn’t find it in himself to regret. He expects to fade into nothingness, to see darkness and then feel nothing but an eternal abyss. He supposed that maybe he would see Corazon in the afterlife, if such a thing existed, but even as he took his final breath he was skeptical. Still, he didn’t expect the sensation of drowning. Nor did he expect the bright light that followed to cause him to gasp and sob for breath.Update (01.05.2022) - ABANDONED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

So why is it that morning Harry woke with a scowl already on his face, and a ball of unease boiling in the pit of his stomach.

“If there’s one thing the Ministry of Magic should’ve learned by now, it’s that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy do not get along.”“And will not get along.”“Oh, shut up.”“You shut up.”“Can you two please, and I mean please, shut the fuck up?”There's an illegal Time-Turner on the loose that the Ministry demands to investigate immediately. Naturally, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are the ones sent to retrieve it.To Harry, it really doesn't matter that Draco's hair is an awfully remarkable shade of silky platinum. Or that you can't tell the difference between his smirks and his genuine smiles unless you're staring at that tiny dimple on his left cheek that only appears when he's actually happy. Or that his brand of sarcasm is so maddeningly endearing they should bottle it and sell it in shops, because Harry would buy it in entire packages and get hopelessly drunk on them after two tiny sips. And it really, really doesn't matter that Harry Potter might--might!--be falling in love with him.

“I’m sorry,” he mumbles.“For what? For ripping this thing?”“No,” though he is a little sorry—before, he always patched up his clothes by himself. But once she got pregnant, Lily said she wanted to learn how to do it, and has used his laundry as practice ever since. Even knowing she wants to do it, he feels like he’s making her, like he’s being lazy. “I’m—well, I’m not much conversation right now.”“You’re not feeling well. Nothing to be sorry for,” she says at once, conviction strong in her words. But then she sighs again, smaller, and rubs her eye with the back of her fingers. He watches her do it, and meets her eyes head on when she looks down at him. Exhaustion lingers, all too familiar. “Truthfully, Moony, I don’t mind the quiet.”

He promises to teach himself everything that has been kept from him, no matter how long it took.He did have to be careful to make sure that Dumbledore knew nothing of what he was doing, which was hard with nosy, spying, friends trying to follow him everywhere.

Harry spoke at Malfoy's trial. It wasn't a planned thing, but he had been thinking about it for a while. He'd been thinking about the fear in Malfoy's eyes, how hopeless his situation had been and how he had never stood a chance. Harry wanted to give him one. Sure, maybe he didn't have to try and convince the guy to sign up to be an Auror, but he did. Maybe he didn't have to volunteer to be his partner when no one else would, but he did. He most certainly didn't have to fall in love with the guy, but, well, he did.

Summer in the Burrow is usually a very happy time, but after Cedric’s death in the TriWizard Tournament, and Harry’s claims that he saw He Who Shall Not Be Named, things were tense. We all believed Harry of course, but with that knowledge that he was telling the truth came fear. My parents were halfway across the world at a dig and I couldn’t bear to be home alone, so naturally, I crashed at the Burrow. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley wouldn’t have it any other way, though I do wonder if they would feel that way if they knew what their sons and I had been up to the previous year. Would we ever get back to that happier time? Would I ever find myself writhing in pleasure beneath their sheets?

“N-no. Omega aren’t — they’re not real.” She’s squirming, pressing herself against him as she talks. “They’re a myth.”“You sure, Granger?” His voice is low. He says her name with a slow drawl as he slides his fingers against her dripping knickers. “Did you ever bother to check? Or did you just assume? I have to admit, as a teenage boy, I was curious to find out. Where do you think half-breeds come from?” He leans close enough to whisper. “Did you think being fucked by a troll is something witches volunteer for?”Granger blinks as though the idea hasn’t occurred to her until just then. He steps closer until there’s barely any space between them. She’s rocking her hips rapidly against his hand. Desire pools in his lower abdomen as his cock begins throbbing in time with his pounding heart.

These are a few ideas I've had for stories set partly within the Vorkosigan universe (frequently crossing it with other fandoms in unlikely combinations).  I don't feel able to write most of them, either because I don't know the setting well enough, or because I have the idea of a beginning of a story but don't know where it will end up, so I'd be interested to hear whether anyone else wants to use them.  Some are inspired by other people's fanfics, which I will include links to.  In these cases, it's probably best if you contact the writer of the original to ask them whether they're okay with your writing a fanfic based on theirs.

Albus Dumbledore isn't an idiot. He knows that putting Harry, a virtually untrained schoolchild, up against Voldemort's guerrilla fighters would sign their death warrants. So he turns to his old friend Yukichi Fukuzawa to ask for a favor and drags Severus with him to Yokohama. A week later, Chuuya Nakahara and Osamu Dazai arrive in Britain, ready to kick ass and take names. And try to commit suicide via moving staircase, but that's just Dazai. (Starts the summer before 6th year and at the conclusion of the Guild arc.)---“Well then, Severus,” Albus said, his voice cheerful. “Onwards and upwards?”Severus sneered. “Upwards, Albus? I seem to have found myself at the top of a hill.""

Harry's 5th year was probably the worst year of his life. First Voldemort happened, then Umbridge, then Voldemort AGAIN, and then Sirius died. Harry doesn't even have the time to properly mourn Sirius before he's shipped back to the Dursley's for the summer. He can't even think straight and with each passing day since losing Sirius, Harry feels more and more exhausted. By the time his 16th birthday rolls around, Uncle Vernon has to literally beat Harry just to wake him up. After a rather brutal beating given to him by his uncle on the eve of his birthday, Harry wakes to find something he had never thought possible. He wakes up to find a long snake tail instead of his legs. A few days later, his family abandons him in some random forest. What a wonderful way to start his 16th year of life after the worst year of his life.* Do not post to another site * Do not translate without permission *

Remus has never had many friends since Hogwarts, a sacrifice he's made to preserve his secret. He's been living in the Muggle world since he was eighteen and has a set schedule, like a middle-aged businessman. When his mum invites (forces) him to attend a  party, dragging him out of his bookshop and encouraging him to finally make some friends, the twenty-one year old comes face to face with an old school mate that might just shake up his carefully planned life.Sirius is bored. He's still adjusting to living without the constant fear of the war and working through his past problems from the Most Abusive and Incestuous House of Black, all while trying to be a good godfather. The number of loose Death Eaters dwindles, along with his work as an Auror, and he misses the thrill. Sirius is worried that the war was the only thing keeping him grounded. But when Lily drags him along to a party, maybe a man he hasn't seen in years can help him start living again.

Harry grows up as a bat, trained by a bat and loved by a Daddy Bat, a Cat, a Spoiler, two sister bats and four Robins. This is Harry Potter's journey as a son, brother, a superhero, and a wizard. This is a transformation story from an abused state to healthy relationships.

This story will follow 5 girls discovering womanhood, identity, and become boss ass witches! I love the world of Harry Potter, but I find the characters and plot annoying. Fight me. I do competitive boxing. I'll win. So basically this will be in the RWRB timeline, since it is the superior timeline, it's in the canon of tedddylupin's dissolving like the setting sun, which is a really good RWRB set in hogwarts, everyone in this is bisexual unless I say they're gay. I'm also really tired of all straight women and then bisexual/gay guys so you might see hint of that in this.

Her youngest was a shy little thing. Nicknamed practically from birth by Bill and Charlie, “Bug” was smaller than any of her others at that age and watched the older boys thoughtfully, never quick to butt into a conversation, preferring to form opinions completely before joining. Once Bug did speak up, though, the other boys were given a run for their money. At only eight, Molly could already tell her youngest was smart, maybe the smartest of her children, though she wouldn’t ever admit that, and Bug’s accidental magic manifestations made Molly think her youngest might also be the most powerful of them all. Really, Bug reminded Molly a lot of herself. Smart, determined, and quietly powerful. She looked forward to what Bug would become.

Sirius and Remus haven't been a couple since they were eighteen. (What happened in the broom cupboard at James and Lily's wedding doesn't count.) Now they've been reunited, but Sirius is well aware he's never been less fanciable - a notorious ex-con moping around Remus's cottage, playing Nick Drake cassettes on repeat, getting into rows with Remus's emotionally manipulative father.While Sirius was in prison, Remus built a new life, one filled with friends and music and activism. His feelings for Sirius haven't changed, but he has no intention of rushing back into a relationship with his ex-boyfriend (or leaving Wales for a mysterious tower in the Scottish Highlands).But the moon has other ideas.

And the last, was probably his favorite. For he had chosen her. She was not outwardly what most people would assume he would want in a follower, but oh how wrong they were. They could not see the potential hidden under frizzy hair and books. He had been swaying her choice subtly. A book on Norse mythology here, a green and gold snake amulet there. His name appearing in places and stories they perhaps shouldn’t. And she was curious, especially now that she knew the magical world was real.

Ginny had danced with Astoria before, but it was nothing like dancing with Astoria now. They were in a world all their own, all smiles and sparkling eyes, floating somewhere far above the rest of the world. Ginny would never understand how she had missed this before, how she had been so oblivious to the way Astoria made her insides flutter and her knees feel like jelly. Astoria was just so good, and maybe that’s what had held Ginny back, too afraid to want someone so beyond comprehension. But somehow, Astoria wanted her too, and the thought kept making all the air leave Ginny’s lungs.---Unapologetically queer, post-war coming-of-age story about queer identity, activism, etc. with a slow-burn Astoria/Ginny romance at its centre. All main protagonists are queer and/or trans. There's queer history, good Slytherins, and close, inter-house friendships.

Sirius is only a year and a half when Regulus is born: he can’t remember anything of that very moment - all he can say about it is that he has loved him since his very first cry. Years later, Sirius would rather die than admit how much he loves his little brother, but at six years old he doesn't have all that pride, neither does he have all that anger that will tear them apart.

“I’m just . . .” Blaise trails off, realizing he probably doesn’t need to explain to Nott why he’s buying lube. Except—he wants to. He wants to explain to Nott why he’s buying lube. In detail. Graphic detail. Exceptional detail. He wants to demonstrate, wants to show off, wants to outline all the ways he’s uniquely qualified to take care of Nott, all the reasons he’s uniquely capable of taking care of Nott. How he can do it better. Do it best. “Yeah.”

He hadn’t wanted to hear Sirius’s apologies, but he saw them. He noticed them in many places, including, but not limited to, notes flown to his desk and long letters under his pillow. Ambushes in the corridors, away from the prying ears of any students, or in their dormitory, with Prongs and Wormtail suddenly needing to run to the library. Quiet knocking on the frame of his poster bed late at night, or fifteen different flavours of fudge on his bedside table. James and Peter as reluctant messengers. Judging by the intense look of anguish mixed with concentration on Sirius’s face whenever he was near, not that he was trying to look, failed attempts at telepathy.

Enigmatic and haunting and probably not worth her time but Florence couldn't look away...It's 1944 and Florence Allman is set to debut to the Wizarding Society of the Southeastern United States in less than a year, which means in less than a year she will be eligible for marriage. Except that she's not ready for that, at least not yet. When her father, a wealthy businessman and plantation owner is offered a deal by the British Ministry of Magic to help fight Gellert Grindelwald, Florence accompanies him from Georgia to England where she is to complete her seventh year of magical education at Hogwarts and experience some of life before it's taken away from her forever. Except that she's woefully behind in her studies, and even worse, there's this boy.

Now Albus is standing in the hospital room and Scorpius is sleeping in the bed in front of him, looking like a fallen angel, and Albus can't find the strength to overcome the distance.

Hermione darted forwards, only to come to a sudden stop. There was a distant figure just beyond the water, on the far side of the cave. Head perked up at what must have been the sound of her footsteps.It was a young, blond man—likely her own age, by the look of it. He was sitting still, hands bound with long chains to the nearby floor. His clothes were worn out and rotten, their style older than anything she had seen even Purebloods in England wear. A geometric pattern too faded to fully recognise stood out on the coat’s breast pocket. His hair fell neatly just above his shoulders despite it. Skin, though caked with dirt and grime, smooth and unblemished.(In which, five years after the war, Hermione meets Gellert Grindelwald whilst searching for something that will cure her parents)

Charles Weasley never decided on marrying, but by just looking at the shivering girl, he knew he had to rescue her. Padma Patil knew of him only by his name, she had never seen him in person. But his red hair, his gentle face, and soulful eyes helped her to agree to the ridiculous offer, "" only marriage can keep her safe from Greyback and his vicious werewolves.""The Battle of Hogwarts just killed one Evil, while another was preparing to strike. Half of Magical Britain is wiped off, and those who remain must join together. The ministry brings out a Magical Marriage Law in an effort to protect those marked by Greyback, who will stop at nothing to eliminate wizards and establish the rule of Werewolves. Black Lotus is a spin-off. Though I plan to get these two characters involved in the main plot at a later date.

Draco sat up in his chair. Why wasn’t she fighting? It’s not like she’d lost her spark; Granger practically commandeered their morning meetings and had no qualms chewing out a co-worker should the need arise. “Lean forward.” Surely, now, he was pushing his luck. She was obeying him for the sake of work, but his arbitrary orders—She leaned forward. Draco sucked in a sharp breath. Very interesting.“Good girl,” Draco breathed. It was instinctive. He wasn’t sure why those words spilt out of his mouth but as her eyes widened and pink suffused through her cheeks, two things were made evident: one, the look on Granger’s face was not fear, and two, Draco's erection was growing painful.

Rey Skywalker is a Seventh Year student at Hogwarts. Ben Solo is her teacher. Her favorite teacher, actually. Her best friends Poe and Finn think that she has a crush on him. And that it's mutual. She thinks they probably got hit too hard on the head by a bludger (which is weird, cause Finn has no idea how to fly). Ben Solo is a great teacher. He is doing what he is the best at and students love him. In his first year teaching at Hogwarts, he finds himself fascinated by one of his students. He is a decent man who knows that teacher-student relationships are forbidden in Hogwarts, so he keeps his distance, but Rey is about to graduate, so he can finally take his chances...

Alternatively: My Immortal Mianite.This fic is a tribute to my favorite bad fanfic and combines my love of weird internet culture with Minecraft Story Series. I have replaced most names with characters from Mianite, Mianite in the role of Dumbledore, Dianite in the role of Voldemort and Ianite as the star of the show as Ebony. The main love interests are played by Jordan as Draco and Tom, who plays Vampire Potter. Sorry Dec and Champwan for casting you guys as Snape and Loopin.The views expressed by the original author in the author's notes do not reflect my own.

They’ve kissed before—fleeting snatches of romantic moments away from the prying eyes of the castle’s many occupants—but today is a new day, a magical day. Today will see the dawn of a new period in their lives: Harry will become his betrothed as well as his beloved. “Soon,” Harry says eventually, when the racing of his heart has slowed to an unremarkable pace. “I want today’s first kiss to be when you wake me from slumber.”Or: Tom Riddle is the love of Harry Potter's life. All he needs to do is wake Harry with a kiss.

Depression. The word was foreign in my mouth. I didn’t have depression. I had a lovely childhood with lots of friends and a loving family. But the quotes on Pinterest about depression and anxiety were so alluring. While I did have extreme social anxiety to the point where I could barely open my mouth in public without a raspy voice, I was not depressed. But I wanted to be. I wanted to be set apart from others, to be different. I would consistently look up ‘depression quotes’ or ‘anxiety quotes’ on Pinterest in hopes to fall into a slump by reading the mood-killing sentences.

Set in a world where all magic folk have soulmarks, each one representing the thing their soulmate is most passionate about. Upon one's soulmate seeing the mark, it becomes full color and completes the soulmate bond, binding two witches' and wizards' powers and creating a strong connection. During the Hogwarts year 1997-1998, Neville Longbottom finds himself doing what he can to resist the dark powers that have forced themselves onto the school. In doing so though, the untimely finding of his soulmate sets him back. What would usually be a joyous occasion especially for a young wizard of his age, is overshadowed by the current events in the world. What's more though is that his soulmate, Arthur McCross, is a Slytherin, one from a group filled with the worst of the worst. Will Neville get past the many preconceived notions he has about Arthur and see the good in him, if there's any at all? And will Arthur break away from fate and learn that the things you love are truly worth standing up for? Only time spent at the hellish year of Hogwarts will tell.

Tears start sliding down her cheeks.""I would thinks so."" James jokes, but his voice doesn't have the right tenor.

Sirius is not sure why she keeps coming back, but maybe satisfying sex and a common taste for dirty talk are sufficient reasons. After the meeting, when most people have left, she takes his hand and silently leads him into the cloakroom and Sirius doesn’t try to stop her.Sirius doesn’t plan to end up listening to her whisper dirty ideas into his ear as he gently eases two fingers into her wet core.He doesn’t plan to end up watching her moan his name as she comes, her hair buried into his father's’ old and mouldy cloak.He doesn’t plan for her to kiss his lips lightly, straighten her skirt and say “promise me you’ll theenk about it Seerius”  leaving him pleasantly horny for the rest of the night.So, as it turns out, Fleur has plans.

I was never really that happy with the Epilogue, it seemed to be a ""happily ever after"" type scenario in only the most conventional terms, none of the characters ever really expressed any desire to get married and have terribly named children.
Plus JK stated after publication that Harry, Ron and Hermione went to work at the Ministry despite them spending the latter half of the series working against the Ministry and learning how easily it can be corrupted. So I changed it completely in this to give them an ending with a bit more urgancy, and that actually makes sense.
I think Harry Potter belongs more to the fans than to J.K. Rowling at this point, if she's more concerned with appeasing her transphobic followers, then the wizarding world should be claimed by the people who actually learned kindness and tolerance from the series, I'd love to see everyone start ammending and adjusting parts of the books they feel aren't as great as they cud have been, and ACTUALLY insert characters from marginalized backgrounds into the actual text.
Please forgive the punctuation/grammatical nightmare, it's been a ong time since i wrote anything so i'm a bit rusty.

When all the death eaters broke out of Azkaban, they woke a certain prisoner who has been in there for a very long time. Practically as long as the prison has been built, maybe even longer. Was he put there because he committed some atrocious crime? No, nothing so dark and dreary. Immortality to some seems like a blessing; some people strive for it, kill for it even. But some see it as a curse of an endless life. Some people wish they were just normal human beings. Living a 100-year lifespan. Maybe even the wizarding 200-year lifespan but no more. One man wishes for death. But could never grasp it. Until he meets the master of it. Or at least the soon to be master.Coming into a new world with Dark Lords and young children fighting in a war, they need not fight. An old sorcerer joins the battle.(Currently editing)

It is now her only home, but Hogwarts and it's people are still full of secrets, some of them ready to be shared...while other are waiting to be created. With Severus Snape still in a magical coma after barely surviving Nagini's bite, McGonagall assuming the Headmistress role permanently and Albus' portrait understanding that he could stop meddling with people so much, many things had changed... And for once in her scholarly path, Hermione is unprepared for the turn of event: the room of requirement require her…just as someone else from the past does to access a brighter future.

Potter defends people, he throws himself into things with moronic Gryffindor bravery, and Draco doesn’t have the heart (what does he have the heart for, he wonders) to tell him that he could save so many more people if he applied a dab of Slytherin cunning to his schemes and machinations. 
 
 But everyone has always hated Slytherins, the whole school hates him and Pansy and Millie and Blaise and Crabbe and Goyle and the rest of them, green-clothed smirking daggers that they are.  
 
 Draco doesn’t bother to explain that Slytherin takes in the battered ones, the one that life has crushed, and sharpens them all into something wicked and strong.  He doesn’t bother to explain that they are cruel but they are kind, that the volley of clever wordplay is fun, sometimes.  Yes, they are sharp and cruel, but they do nothing the world hasn’t done to them already, and people are so fucking hypocritical.
 
He doesn’t have the heart to.

Tom Riddle’s reputation in the Wizarding World is this: ambitious, intelligent, powerful, and undoubtedly the next Minister for Magic - if only he would quit his job at Borgin and Burkes. His intentions fool everyone but Hermione Granger.When their paths cross in 1948 due to a business deal and a cursed necklace, Tom and Hermione find themselves the friendliest of enemies. Temptation has many faces, but to Hermione, Tom Riddle’s is the most irresistible.  ""I once told you that power always wins. There is no good or evil, Hermione. It is a fine line. Do you see that now?"" Hermione stared indifferently down to the man writhing in pain at her feet. She twirled her wand carelessly in her fingers as she replied, ""I do.""  Tom smirked and tucked a curl behind her ear, his fingers stained in blood. ""Good girl.""~ This story uses characters from, but is not affiliated with, JK Rowling and the Harry Potter series. Warning: dark themes (some graphic), sexual content, language, and slow-burn. This is also an AU, in which Hermione Granger is a pure-blooded witch living in Tom Riddle’s original timeline.

“I know why you said it.” he suddenly hears Namjoon sigh. Jin snaps his head to the side, searching Namjoon’s face. Still looking at the water, he continues.“Last year. When you dated Noah. I know you don’t like to talk about it, so I won’t, but I think that’s where your response earlier came from.”Jin’s breath punched out of him at the mention of the boy. How could he ever forget Noah.

They’ve been quarantined in their flat for twelve days now, but with the way things are carrying on outside, it is looking like this could possibly last months. Remus, the introvert, is just now beginning to feel the effects of being sequestered away from the world, but Sirius started going stir-crazy around day four. But, they’ve managed to keep one another distracted with different activities: baking together, catching up with their ever growing Netflix queue, reading out loud to each other, and plenty of frisky romps in the sack followed by sweaty and sticky cuddling.

Boris Juester von Jurgens-Ratenicz finds a particular owl awaiting for him one summer evening. A Snowy White, he recalls and finds a particular note attached to the owl. A Family Tree, he discovers, where he is surprised to note two half-sisters, one by the name Petunia and the other Lily. After discovering they both have, or had in Lily's case, family. Boris wanted to learn more about this side of the family and if they were just as crazy as the ones he knows. In any case, it was best to let them know about the illness on the male side of the family, having no doubt his father might've passed it to his half-siblings and their male children. Of course, that was until he discovered one Harry Potter, his nephew, was not...treated well.This is Harry's story of living in America with his new uncle and the drama that seems to unfold.Will be set around Season 3 of Royal Pains

It's odd, really, that they all have the same tradition. With Malfoy, it's probably some rich person thing or other, a whim passed down through his sicko semi-fascist family. Makes sense.But with Harry, Luna and Hermione, it's almost pure coincidence. Harry comes to the bonfire despite knowing nobody there, because he celebrates the winter solstice for... for his own reasons. Hermione goes because Lavender forced her into it. Luna goes because Ginny went, and because the fire is pretty.Coincidence. The cogs of fate turning in a way that seems random at best.Luna doesn't believe in coincidence. Draco thinks Luna is crazy. Hermione thinks coincidence is just a part of life.But Harry can't help but wonder... could coincidence just be another word for destiny?

There are parts of his past, parts of himself that he would like to cut out. Only when they are removed, Draco Malfoy is sure, he can feel whole again. He had meant to start over, not end up in St. Mungo's psychiatric ward where he realises that the road to redemption is not an easy one, especially not when Dark Magic is still lurking around every corner. In his fight against his own past and new enemies, hope can appear in the strangest shapes and sizes, and sometimes, in the form of an annoyingly persistent healer named Astoria Greengrass.

Is this story a little oddball of a head canon? Yep. But as quarantine drags itself out to the bitter end, do you honestly have something better to do than read it?So buckle-up buttercup, we're diving off the non-canon deep end. What if The Cursed Child wasn't annoying as hell? What if Draco Malfoy had a daughter instead of a son? What if Libra Malfoy was the greatest witch of her age and the world wanted to burn her alive for it? What if she and Albus Potter joined forces and decided to repay the favor?If canon is the hill you want to die on, may I suggest looking elsewhere. If you happen to be tired of Rowling macerating the legacy of the original books, well then, read on. There will drama. There will be angst. There will be gays (gasp). There will be a love for magic, wild and unbridled. I don't know about you, but I'm ready to go back to Hogwarts.

After a miserable ending to an otherwise magical first year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter wants nothing more than to escape the clutches of his muggle relatives once more and return to the world in which he belongs. His brother Charlus, the Boy-Who-Lived, wants nothing more than to redeem his own failures and prove to not just the wizarding world, but to himself as well that he is more than just some child celebrity.Unbeknownst to Harry and Charlus, the two of them will have to struggle with more than their own personal demons. There is a monster roaming the halls of Hogwarts, one controlled by an equally mysterious Heir of Slytherin, one who is seemingly hell-bent on destroying Hogwarts from the inside out. How will the Potter twins react to threats from this Heir of Slytherin, along with their own personal struggles, both internal and external? And what of the enigmatic Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor who seems to be far more than what meets the eye?

When Severus Snape banked on being dead at the end of a war, it was as much of a shock as a burden to find out he was very much alive. He'd rather welcome oblivion and be known as a hero, than watch himself become a listless ghost of his former self. He never expected his Life After Death would contain much but living an isolated, quiet, life. Instead he somehow ended up returning to Hogwarts to teach, becoming involved in student affairs he'd rather stay far removed from, and most importantly, having copious amounts of sex with his old childhood enemy- Remus Lupin. Recovery is a fickle and long road, and he certainly didn't expect his would involve accepting Remus as part of it.(Now being translated into Korean by the lovely and dedicated Jagabee:https://archiveofourown.org/works/29211414 )

Sirius is trapped behind the Veil for what seems like years on his end, minutes on the other side. He is not alone, however, but trapped with Leta LeStrange, who entered the purgatorial realm when Grindelwald seemingly incinerated her.

Potter must have been having nightmares again. He was restless in his bed across the room. Moonlight shone through his open bed curtains and highlighted the contours of his body, the grimace on his face blatant. His thick blanket was kicked down, one leg still covered by his twisted sheet, the musk of his sweat pungent in their small dorm. Low grunts accounted for the majority of the noise he made, but it was peppered by the occasional groan or unclear shout of words. However, ‘No,’ was always clear. Draco hated it.

Escorting trouble-making students back to their dorms and breaking up midnight duels and secret lovers gets old after the first few times they do it; quidditch, on the other hand, never gets old. Nor does winning against Marcus. Katie blames it on the fact that she spent two years at Hogwarts trying to entice a bludger in his direction whenever she wasn’t chasing the quaffle. It gave her a lifelong satisfaction in winning games against Marcus Flint, even now when they’re a quidditch instructor and a Muggle Studies professor rather than Slytherin and Gryffindor chasers.

The conclusion of the AO3 work Sarcasm and Slytherin. Chapters 1-16 are available here. https://archiveofourown.org/works/15848610/chapters/36912186This is Sunmoonandstars, back from the dead. Original work summary:  Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.Happy reading everyone. I have no clue when book 6 is going to be done or ready to post but have at least the end of book 5 because it's been languishing on my hard drive for too long.

“Well, are you aware there’s an owl perched on your shoulder?” The other boy said, and inclined his chin in Hedwig’s direction. Harry laughed at that.
“That’s Hedwig—she’s my friend,” he replied, and stroked her soft head.

Newt was his first friend. That meant something to Harry, who had grown up unloved and alone. He'd make sure Newt never felt the same—no matter what.

He's on the edge of something, though he doesn't know what it is yet. But there's a choice before him, one he almost doesn't want to make.Draco's been the potions master at Hogwarts for four years.

“You know Professor Lupin was a werewolf?” Hermione said, ten minutes into a very awkward lunch she had asked for in an equally awkward letter.
Lavender pushed a sauteed carrot through a little puddle of pasta sauce. “I think everyone heard about that one. Someone told the papers, or something, right?”
“Er, yes,” said Hermione. “Snape did. Which is what I– I mean, it’s related. Oh, I wish you’d gotten to talk to Remus about this. He was a lovely man.”
“Not as lovely as Lockhart,” Lavender said and she and Hermione spent a moment in wistful remembrance. “God, I feel old,” Lavender said.
“Anyway, Snape,” said Hermione. “Snape and Lupin. When Lupin was at school, Snape would make him a potion that would… tame him, on full moons. He could just curl up in his office and sleep by the fire. If you’re interested, I’m trying to learn how to brew it myself.”
Lavender shook her head. “We’re not friends,” she said. “Never have been. So why are you doing all this?”
Hermione looked like she was trying to say “we’re friends,” but she couldn’t get it out.

Severus offers him a deal, fearful it will tear them apart forever, but Harry has a solution that gives everyone a happy ending. Based on the snippet floating about the net of a fae asking for a woman's firstborn in return for her mother's life and being very, very surprised by her interpretation of his demands.

We all know the story of 'The Boy Who Lived'. Every child knows his name. Everyone loves the tale of how Harry Potter saved the Wizarding World from Voldemort.But do we know the story of 'The Greatest Sorcerer Ever To Walk The Earth'? Every time Ron cried, ""Merlin's beard!"", did we stop to wonder who exactly Merlin was, and what he had done to be recognized worldwide and have an order named after him?
This is the story of a young boy, who thought that he was a nobody, growing into a man, who would be remembered for centuries.

Hermione returns to Hogwarts for her 'eighth' year without Harry and Ron, with the horrors of the war still fresh in her mind, but determined to start anew. Malfoy seems subdued, altered by the events of the past year or so, though he's not without his acerbic tongue. Assigned Theodore Nott as her patrol partner for their prefect duties, she finally has the time to get to know the two Slytherins, and discovers that there's a whole lot more to them than the prejudice of their past and the snake on their house badge. Slow-burn Draco x Theo x Hermione, endgame happy trio with lots of fluff and smut.*Sporadic updates! Be warned...*

As the third daughter of the Ruling Mother of Venus, Hermione supposes she should have expected that she would be the one that’s most practical to be married off to some stranger half-way across the solar system, but that doesn’t mean she likes the idea—because she doesn’t. At all. Especially after she found out that she was betrothed to a boot-licking Martian! And the worst part is, the Martian she needs to marry is none other than Draco Malfoy, the only son of Voldemort’s third-in-command. Oh, how will she ever survive this ordeal?

The Dark Lord was successful in killing Harry Potter, and the wizarding world has suffered under the new reigns of his unforgiving band of Death Eaters. The Order has since been hunted down and marked as enemies of the new political state. The Canary is a notorious member of the resistance and is wanted for relaying crucial information about the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters. As such, there is a steep reward for whomever manages to seize this faceless, nameless war criminal. Seize is not exactly the word Draco Malfoy would use to describe how the interaction went, but hey, he didn't expect to discover who the Canary really was… and he certainly didn't expect to fall in love with her either. Canon-compliant until Battle of Hogwarts.

Where there is a handsome and noble prince, there is an innocent and benevolent maiden whom requires rescuing from a curse bestowed upon her. It is also true that where there is power, there is a man prepared to seize it at any cost. This story has many elements (twisted fairytale, soulmates, historical fantasy, etc) but it does take place in an AU where Potterverse magic exists and is quite a dark read.

With the war finally over, you’d think Harry would finally be granted that “normal life” he’s always dreamt about. Finally free from the Dursleys, from that nose-less megalomaniac, from Horcruxes, Hollows, Death Eaters, Dementors, Prophecies… you’d think that he, for the first time in his life, would be allowed to be just a normal teenager. You’d think he’d deserve that much, right?But then you haven’t considered Luna Lovegood. Luna, who has the most whimsical ideas that no one ever takes seriously. Luna, who apparently has Swedish heritage and knows about some strange Summer Solstice ritual that she wants to perform. Luna, who’s so sweet and kind that you can’t help but humour her when she offers you some distraction from your post-war confusion.Harry knows he should’ve known better, knows he shouldn’t have let her persuade him to go through with it. But he did.And now, Harry’s life will probably never be normal again.

“This is a state of the art, all-in-one 15-inch iMac G3,” Harry gushed, hand stroking the side of the machine. “It came in Bondi Blue but I thought I would change the colour of the housing to suit my new nails.” At this, Harry wiggles his hand at Voldemort to emphasise his point.Voldemort stares at Harry blankly, at a loss as to which part of Harry’s incoherent statement he should attempt to deconstruct first.""Of course, you can choose Strawberry for the outer casing but the bastards were going to charge more. What’s the point of having magic if you’re not going to use it to cheat The Man, right?

titled inspired by the quote: ""Never saw one without the other, did you?... Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!"" AU where Remus and Sirius decide they want to have a child of their own after hearing about Lily's pregnancy. Marlene is a willing surrogate, and nine months later, both children are both born. They grow up together for a short amount of time, but then the Potters are betrayed and Remus is left alone to raise their child. basically if you want to re-read the books but also want wolfstar lol. will be diverging from canon on several key points. (Sirius and Remus both live, Harry will move in with Remus and Sirius after year three)This is a rewrite. I've changed canonical quotes to fit my own story. If I come across something JKR had a character say that was problematic, I'll erase it. But I won't ignore valid character flaws. *not a fan of JKR or her disgusting views. there will be lots of LGBTQIA representation in this fic.*https://open.spotify.com/playlist/14miu9hjun1f1vdKSPcrsO?si=t2yxPsvkR0m5TVIgVwQ_Zw&dl_branch=1

This is the reason why all of her friends believe she decided to testify in favor of Lucius, Narcissa and Draco Malfoy.But what if the reason she decided to testify was because she felt more connected to the circusntances of their case because she is one of the few of the Light side that understood the reasons behind their alliance with the Dark Lord and wanted to give them the opportunity to change their ways. Even if Lucius and Draco are still being assholes.A Malfoy ball may be the perfect opportunity to unite purebloods with Muggleborns and Half Bloods, and also may be the door to discovering that Hermione´s lifestyle may have more similarities with that one of a pureblood.

Severus Snape may have escaped Azkaban, but he does not go throughout life unencumbered. Despite his desire to attempt to forge an ordinary life, he must struggle against the obstacles presented by his unique situation. First his recently re-animated feud with James Potter; then, both Dumbledore and the Ministry doing their best to keep their leashes tight and - perhaps most concerningly - he now has a devoted fan, and one that is doing their best to imitate some of his deadliest potions. As the goals of his copycat become clearer, Severus' newly shaped moral principles will truly be put to the test.

Draco found himself waiting for Hermione to pull away.Any second now she’d do it. She’d go still in his arms, then tug back from him, looking shaken or even alarmed, and she’d say, what are we doing, or maybe what am I doing, and he’d be forced to consider the questions himself. And then she’d spiral into descriptions of the short-term and long-term consequences, probably structured like an argumentative essay which, written down, would have filled three feet of parchment.Minutes passed, though, and she didn’t go still.---a Disappearances outtake that happens between chapters sixteen and seventeen. it's literally just kissing. thank you for your time

Harry Potter, but not as you remember.For as long as he can remember, Harry Potter has lived in a cupboard under the stairs at Number 4 Privet Drive. As his 11th birthday approaches, someone seems very determined to send him a letter - and his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seem just as determined to make sure he never reads it. But what could a letter say that's so important? And why can Harry do things that no one else can?this is fueled completely by my hatred on JK Rowling.

The Boy Who Lived. The Chosen One. The Boy Who Lived Twice. Harry Potter, who was now currently snogging Ginny Weasley, had many names, but he preferred 'just Harry'. The war was over and he didn't want to look back on it. They had mourned their dead, which happened to be one of the most difficult parts of dealing with the aftermath of the Great Battle of Hogwarts, the Death Eaters were imprisoned, Voldemort was gone for good, and Harry Potter just wanted to focus on the future, his future, with Ginny.Nothing could go wrong, right?

What if Remus didn't keep his relationship to Harry's parents a secret throughout third year. What if from the first time he saw him after driving away the dementors he decided to tell Harry the truth. Remus makes a decision and the bond between Harry and him grows. Trust and love lead to a very different third year for Harry Potter, and that makes all the difference.Remus watches as Harry stirs and when those green eyes meet his something jolts in his mind. A longing so strong overwhelms him, a yearning for his family. How he hates how cautiously those eyes look at him, like a stranger.I used to be Uncle Moony and he used to be my cub.2/12/22: On Hiatus, Sorry all life's been a bit busy, hope I can return to this eventually.

Hermione Granger took a sip of her tea, long since bitter on her tongue and she stared down at the Daily Prophet's front page, sensational news splashed across the front page in black and white. Mr. and Mrs. Brown stared up at her balefully as the Wizengamot debated in colorless fervor. 'WAR HERO POTTER FAILS IN BID TO KEEP GREYBACK IN AZKABAN', drifted across the page, looping and swirling in between the smaller text as the photograph looped again and again, Mrs. Brown burying her face into a handkerchief as the verdict rang out. Hermione scoffed, and, with a quick flick of her wand, watched as the paper went up in flames. _

When they make a potion completely wrong, Harry becomes 5 again. When Draco must be his caretaker, he realizes, he's in love with the brunette. Not the 5-year-old, but the 17-year-old. What happens now?!

Ah yes, third year. The year that has the least to do with Voldemort yet so much happens. Too bad for Hogwarts they have a reckless Slytherin who is getting tired of taking baby steps. Slow and steady may win the race, but there's nothing wrong with taking a few shortcuts. What's the worst that could happen? Besides, if Hogwarts won't actively give Harry a normal year, he'll make one for himself.

The Hufflepuff common room had many advantages, the main one being that it was always warm, and this was what had allowed for me and Kim to curl on one of the sofas, each with a book in hand, as we tested each other on the various potions that would be in the upcoming 5th year potions test. “come on y/n, you know this one, Slughorn is making us do it next lesson,” I shot her a dark look, as she fiddled with a strand of her grey hair, “you know I don’t pay a word of attention to anything that man says,” I mumbled flicking through the textbook once more. “well you should,” she teased, “he’s very intelligent, when he’s trying,” I scoffed quietly, “he has a framed picture of every slug club he ever hosted, including one with you know who, he is odious.” Grumbling several curse words, I stretched, and reached for a different textbook, “have you got rounds tonight?” she asked, as I tied my hair into a bun, spearing it in place with a disused quill.

My uncle didn’t believe I could pick my way through the lock.” At this point he smirks, “with this,” he holds up a hairpin triumphantly. Harry feels his eyes go wide “Are you sure that’s  not magic?” He laughs breathlessly at this odd boy, who look at him and not away like everyone else at school who sees Harry being chased by Dudley’s gang and leaps out of their path. This boy who doesn’t wrinkle his nose at Harry’s oversized, worn sweaters. Who unlock doors with hairpins and see strange things happening around Harry (possibly the strangest thing that has happened yet) and grins.

There are 3 all powerful objects used to escape Death. These objects were gifted to humanity.One was a wand, a wand so powerful that it could defeat any enemy in its path. The trail of bodies it left in its wake gave it the title Death Stick. Another was a stone, one that could bring back the dead. Not just a reanimation of the bodies, but fully interacting souls. This brought it the title of Resurrection Stone.  The last was a cloak, one that can be used to hide from anyone and anything even, and most importantly, Death. This one was dubbed the Invisibility cloak. These three powerful objects brought about pain, joy, death, and solace. They were used in evil schemes and good. However what most do not know is that these three things were alive. [ 100+ drabbles of the Deathly Hallows. ]

Okay, so…Draco Malfoy has a thing for Harry Potter. Honestly, how could he not?When Harry invites him to be his ""date"" to his friends' wedding, Draco goes all-in on a soul-bearing display of his real feelings for the man. Once it becomes obvious that he misinterpreted Harry's intentions, Draco begins to feel like all hope has been lost on his Chosen One ever returning those feelings. Through the magic of the Summer Solstice (and perhaps a bit too much wine), he finally finds the courage to take his shot.

As rain lashed against the window pane, Hermione carried two mugs of tea over to the window seat. She took a moment to regard her companion before she handed one of the drinks to George without a word, and his lips quirked into the smallest of smiles; a silent thanks as he shifted his long legs to make room for her. When they were younger, Hermione had never really know what to make of the Weasley twins, but now George was a broken half of a whole, they'd somehow fallen into a surprisingly easy friendship that no-one would have predicted, least of all her.

The War is over and everything has changed.After a few of years of travelling around the world, Harry decided to move to Muggle London, looking for peace and a place where the scar on his forehead doesn’t have a meaning. His new flat is in a perfectly normal neighbourhood close to the centre, quiet during the day but full of students at night. He really likes the small bar down the road, a place that serves cheap, awful drinks and plays good old classics. It’s always crammed with people talking, laughing or dancing along with the riff of electric guitars.From the first time he crossed the threshold, Harry thought it was perfect, the right mix of noise and warmth to be alone without feeling alone. Just what he needed. He couldn’t imagine that someone else was there for the very same reason, looking for a place where the Dark Mark was only a tattoo.Blame it on the alcohol, on the music or whatever you want, but when Harry’s eyes landed on Draco’s slim figure, swaying on the dancefloor, something warm and inexplicable possessed him.

It was a man at the door, and he walked in with an odd mixture of extreme self assurance and that same social fear she'd shown, herself, only a moment ago. His hair was black and stringy, looking clean but not altogether cared for, like parts of it had been burnt or cut away with a blunt knife. His face was young, like hers, but incredibly worn, like he'd been driven to exhaustion a few too many times. The suit he wore was nice, expensive, definitely, but draped over his nearly skeletal form like he'd never even consulted a tailor.He took off his hat, grey to match his coat, and held it against his chest. ""Hey, Hermione, do you mind if I talk to you for a bit? I just need some advice.""Stunned, she gestured an arm, stepping back to allow him into the library proper, instead of just the doorway. ""How did you know my name?""

Sirius Black was more than the not-so-secret-keeper of Lilly and James Potter. He was a friend. He was a confidant. And, well, this may seem ironic but he was, in fact, a secret keeper. He had kept Lily Potter's biggest secret from even his best friend. But not, well, now things were different. Harry Potter was in grave danger in England and even Dumbledore couldn't keep him safe, which the headmaster had proven when he had allowed Harry Potter to be dragged away to resurrect the Dark Lord. So yeah, sometimes desperate times call for desperate measures. But sending Harry Potter to New York City to meet his actual father? Might be a little bonkers.

Harry's been in self-exile for nearly a decade. A series of betrayals and sacrifices and terrible losses has made him an outcast to the magical world and a stranger to the muggle one. Aimless and struggling to survive, he befriends a green monster on the slopes of the Western Ghats and years later gets drawn in the type of adventuring that torn him apart many years ago. 
But kindness and teamwork and the type of understanding that come from being a monstrous kind of hero pulls Harry deeper and deeper into a family he never asked for. 
The world is changing. Threats from the Ministry of Magic and from SHIELD create a thin line for Harry to straddle to protect his dear friends. And all the while, something comes, searching for the cornerstones of existence, to control and destroy the universe.
Harry remains, as always, tied to Death and Destiny. A martyr? A magician? A madman? Or a master of the deathly hallows?

After the war, Draco is recruited into the Department of Love (aka Cupid's Arrow). His job is to bring together witches and wizards whose magical signatures are only compatible with each others' (essentially soulmates). As they all learned during training, Cupids are chosen because they do not have soulmates.
Six years later, Draco's convinced himself that he's perfectly fine with not having a soulmate. But his latest client turns out to be Harry Potter, and he's forced to reconsider in light of his old feelings.

Raised by his doting Muggle grandparents, Tom Riddle grows up hating purebloods, not Muggles. Still as vicious and sociopathic as ever, he is determined to stage a violent insurrection against pureblood supremacy. As he rises to power in Slytherin, he recruits every disenfranchised Muggleborn and halfblood against the purebloods that have traditionally controlled his house.After opening the Chamber of Secrets, Tom organises his followers into a covert revolutionary vanguard known only as the Chosen. Delving into the Dark Arts, Tom searches not for horcruxes but for disturbing new ways of devouring the magic of purebloods, adding it to his own. He will use any means necessary to eradicate what he believes is a drain on magic itself—pureblood society’s obsession with blood purity.Then, in Tom’s sixth year, a powerful halfblood named Harry Haywood appears at Hogwarts and seems to hate Tom on sight, even though they both agree that purebloods like Grindelwald are dangerous maniacs who should be stopped.Mystified and intrigued by this potential new ally, Tom seeks to recruit Harry into the Chosen, but things don’t go exactly as planned...

Remus didn’t want to be stereotypical.I mean, he didn’t even fit his stereotype.He didn’t cuff his jeans, and he most definitely didn’t listen to Sweater Weather by The Neighborhood.But this man, this one sitting right at table 12, he had tattoos up his arms and too many earrings in one ear. He had three rings on one hand that he twirled non-stop. He wore a cropped long sleeve sweatshirt that he obviously cut himself, biker boots, and tight jeans. Not that Remus had been looking at his jeans. Obviously.

Harry Potter, of all people, knows that life isn’t always fair. And no one gets to be happy all of the time. But surely there’s something more—something better—than a rubbish Ministry job, and a lonely old house, and that feeling that everyone out there is doing a better job of living than Harry is.
And it really doesn’t seem fair that Draco Malfoy is back in Harry’s life, all of a sudden, and even though he’s wandless, and living with Muggles, and making his mother cry with his lifestyle choices, he’s happy. So what's he doing right, that Harry isn’t? 
Because things don’t really change, do they? And if Harry can’t be happy, he’ll settle for a good night’s sleep, some posh antiques, and the opportunity to find out what Malfoy has been up to for all these years.
And that’s what starts it all.

Ambition, the desire to be better than you are, is only ever as good as its cause. Motivated by pride, selfishly seeking power for one's own personal gain is a dangerous game considered evil more often than it's considered good. But it isn't inherently evil. After all, if you're at the bottom, where else do you have to go but up? And why should you help those that pushed you down there on your climb up?
Dillion Lux had just wanted to expand his skills, to learn something not often mastered. There was no ulterior intent beyond a desire to learn for his own personal gain. But, apparently, even just studying the dark arts tainted him. In a second, after one small slip up, Dillion Lux lost everything.
Tom Riddle has always had nothing. The only thing that's ever been his is his own power, the one that kept him safe when he had to defend himself against the muggle bullies. So it should be reasonable that he would want to grow it, that he would want to have it all. But it is not.
The Dark Arts aren't inherently evil, just as Tom and Dillion aren't. But it's hard to remember that when everyone around them seems to think the opposite.

The announcement of the Triwizard tournament had sent Beauxbatons into a hub of excited whispers, and it was these same excited whispers that had hummed on in the background as we travelled via carriage to Hogwarts. “did Viktor enter?” Fleur asked from beside me, her blonde hair had been curled to perfection, and unlike me, she actually seemed excited about the beginning of the tournament, “yes he did,” I murmured quietly, wringing my hands in my lap. It was bad enough that Durmstrang had stopped taking female students the year before we were set to go to secondary school, but this being the first time we would see each other again in several months, felt like an invasion on our relationship. We had a lot of time to make up, and this really wouldn’t allow for that to happen. “I'm sure he’ll be fine,” she attempted to assure me, the other students in our carriage smiled across at me – it was no secret how close me and Viktor were, as twins but as siblings in a wider sense too, we understood each other impeccably in every single way, and had a love for each other that no one could break. Though I dared them to try.

Percy Jackson is not a demigod in this one. Born into the Harry Potter Universe unknowingly apart of the magical world, and far more important than he could ever expect. Can Percy manage to survive the coming war, or even his magical classes?Basically Percy finds out he's the current heir to the House of Black and his great-grandfather, Arcturus, wishes his grand kids were more respectful of his old heart and didn't get into so much trouble. Also, Percy tells people about the future but has no idea that he does.

Sirius had been asked out on a date by some guy from Ravenclaw, Michael, or Matthew or whatever his name was. Remus really couldn’t care less. It really wouldn’t have bothered Remus so much if he hadn’t been pining for the dark haired boy since third year. His little crush only increased after Sirius had come out to him and their other friends back in fourth year, and he had been trying to work up the courage to ask Sirius out himself ever since. He was stupid to think he had plenty of time to do so.

When Harry Potter irrevocably dragged Draco Malfoy into his life, it was without a warning, and he called him by the wrong name the entire time. To be fair, Draco only realised it was Harry Potter at the same time that Potter realised he wasn’t ‘Liam’, so those two things kind of cancelled each other out. All you had to do was squint.
In hindsight, those weren’t the best conditions. Not that the conditions were really important, because Draco got pulled in no matter which way you wanted to look at it. And here is how it happened.

Sirius had the distinct feeling that the only reason all his friends were sitting in a circle in the middle of the Gryffindor common room at one in the morning playing silly muggle party games was for his sake. Some plan James had come up with in a desperate attempt to cheer him up. It wasn’t working. The only reason Sirius himself was even still sitting there rather than going off to sulk in the dorm was because he did not want to have to explain himself or his depressive mood to the whole group. James, Peter and Remus of course knew the reason behind Sirius’ glum mood, but they had kept it properly under wraps at his request. Sirius definitely didn’t want everyone to know what had happened this summer, how his parents had thrown him out onto the streets, barely breathing. He didn’t want to see the pity in their eyes or for them to look at him as weak or pathetic or anything of the sort. He didn’t want them to know how torn up he really was about it.

Hardly anyone would observe Anjali Kumar and James Potter at school and conclude that they were related in any way. Anjali was the opposite of her extraverted cousin. Well, not quite the opposite, exactly—more like his natural foil, the anti-James, so to speak. Anjali just wants to finish her schooling without any drama so she can become a Magic Naturalist and specialize in Magical Diplomacy. But when adult unicorns go missing in the Forbidden Forest and fairies start turning up dead, it's up to Anjali to figure out what's going on and stop the killings, once and for all.Now, if only she could stop getting distracted by one Sirius Black.(prequel to HP fanfic The Revolutionary!

There were so many things about Scorpius that had always been there, that were beginning to be more apparent to Albus. Like how he looked in glasses, and his rosy-cheeks, and how his eyes shone whenever he laughed. Every time Albus would see his slim fingers carding through the pages of a book, or watch his face relax completely while he cast a spell, he’d get butterflies. And no matter how hard he tried to push them down, to repress his growing feelings, he couldn’t deny it, at least not from himself, any longer. ---Following Albus and Scorpius from fifth year onward, because no, it doesn't all happen in one year.

To learn, to fight, and to protect, the journey to defeat the Dark Lord will stretch far beyond the British Isles. Meanwhile, Voldemort grows with each victory, determined to complete his true mission and bring the muggle world to its knees.Children break their shackles to become more, and gods are forged through magic and blood. A tale of coming-of-age, rebellion, and apocalypse, in a world teetering on the brink of madness.

Slowly Ron uncovers more and more cruelties thrust upon the losing side's families, and the more he sees the harder time he has staying silent. Even if it may cost him greatly in the end.

I'm going to be honest. I'm a trans woman and I simply got tired of all of J.K. Rowling's transphobic nonsense. Spitefully, I wrote this fic with one simple idea: what if Harry Potter was trans? I am interested in seeing where this may go in the future. It starts off pretty similarly to the original story, but it became clear fairly quickly that Mary and Harry are not the same character. With the added difficulty of not only growing up with the Dursleys, but also growing up transgender--which the Dursleys are not supportive, naturally, since they want everything to be normal in the strictest sense of the word. Harry always had hope that things would change at the beginning, but Mary has a much different outlook.

Hermione and Luna are getting ready to take their summer sabbatical from their work in the DoM. This time, however, they’re not leaving out the front door. They’re going to stage a “careless mistake,” and finally use the time turners they’ve discovered that are inscribed with their names. Their “real,” names. They have no idea when or where they might end up, if they’ll be together, or if they will be able to return, but after having to hide away in the DoM for over a hundred years they’re ready to move on. Why do they have to hide? Well it’s tiresome having to wear a glamour to go out to avoid questions and interrogations when you haven’t aged a day past 25 years old when you’re nearing a hundred years old.

Everyone has desires, some simple, some deeper. But they all yearn for happiness, for suffering to pass and for the future to be better. Hermione wants it. Fred wants it too.But life is a cruel game.The rumor had suddenly died out, and even the night seemed to get darker. Ron and Harry had retired to their rooms to sleep, as had Ginny and George. Hermione, on the other hand, was stalling in the dark. She wanted to enjoy the silence broken only by the song of the cicadas. She would call it the calm before the storm, which it was. She felt lost, shrouded in fear mixed with resignation, a contradiction due to the uncertain future that lay before her. She had been forced to eliminate her memory from her parents' minds to avoid suffering, and at the age of seventeen she was living that hell again, but Hermione had promised herself she wouldn't concert too much on herself, because after all she wasn't the only one suffering.

Jane Chatwin has a plan to destroy The Beast once and for all but before she sets her plan in motion for the first (of 40) times she plans a magic-free vacation a single lifetime to recapture the childhood she lost. Unfortunately for her, the 'magicless' world she chooses is anything but. Now as Lily Evans she must navigate a new world of magic and hope it doesn't cause as much heartache as her previous one. She didn't expect to fall in love or fight another madman to save the world. Ratings and warnings may change (probably will :)**Changes made to chapters 1-6 as of April 11, 2021**

“Actually, Thes, quite frankly, I believe you deserve worse,” Newt says unhappily. At that, Theseus laughs.

The year of 1993 is a bad year for Severus Snape. With Potter in harm's way, the convicted murderer Black escaped, the dangerous Lupin back in Hogwarts and Dumbledore purposefully oblivious to his concerns, Severus starts to crack under the pressure early on. It is such a special year that the desperate Potions Master is given by Fate a superpower like no others: the Path to Victory.Thanks to a certain magical symbiote, he gains the power to achieve anything the Universe allows, as long as he asks the right question.But as everyone knows, Severus Snape is not a nice man. Plagued by grudges, wounds and regrets, how can this man handle such power without developing a maddening God Complex?

Harry Potter was raised to be a “Christian”, but the Dursleys don’t practice what they preach. When his Hogwarts letter comes, he is thrust into a wizarding world where angels, demons, and pagan gods fight in the shadows for influence over the world. A lighthearted, irreverent romp through a world where all myths are true, Hermione Granger met her first demon at six years old, and Ronald Weasley really wishes his brothers would stop showing off. Updates every weekend. Comments welcome. Romance happens eventually, but at a slow real-world pace.

There are several moments in Teddy’s life he knows he won’t ever forget. The day Harry first took him flying and he wet his trousers. Being sorted at Hogwarts. Making Head Boy. Realizing he was pansexual. Being accepted as an Unspeakable. 
This is one of those moments. His dick gets hard so fast it almost hurts, and without even consciously deciding to do so he arches his hips up, letting out a little moan.
James hums, kissing his way up the side of Teddy’s neck and across the sharp curve of his jawline up towards his ear. “You wanna be my good boy?”

Sick of the Dursleys and resolved to missing his few friends if it means getting away from the people of the Wizarding World and their nosy whispers, Harry gets the idea to leave it all behind for a while, just a bit, just for a rest. Like a camping trip, except he’ll take enough provisions for a year or so...maybe some plants, seeds and things for a little garden. Maybe some time away from the things that weigh him down will help the constant highs and lows he’s been feeling for a while now. Just a little break. (Or, the one where Harry says TTFN and takes himself off on an indefinite vacation and upsets a few very careful plans.)

""He had been prepared to deal with Hadrian. Eager, even, to have a new challenge.  
But he was definitely not ready to face one of the most powerful and influential people in the wizarding world. Warning bells and red alarms were sounding in his head and screaming at him to get out. It was a weird feeling, considering that it was usually Tom who made others feel wary of him. Carefully looking at Grindelwald, who was less than 3 feet away from him, he couldn’t help but feel like he was in the territory and presence of a much bigger, much tougher predator. It brought up feelings from his past- from the orphanage. Back when he was weak. He did not like the sudden resurfaced sensation and he swallowed the ball of resentment.""  
 
At the annual Malfoy Yule Banquet, the most powerful figure in Europe, Lord Grindelwald, shows up- with his young protégé, and sole heir, Hadrian Potter. Knowing that becoming acquainted with a person as influential as Hadrian Potter would ensure that numerous opportunities would open up for Tom and his goals, he tries to maneuver the other boy to his benefit. But who is really leading who here?

Barty has a blog. Well, a Twitter account, but close enough. This chapter is pretty much pure crack. Part 9 of my Arrested Development series, in which a young Harry, abused by the Dursleys, is magically transported to Azkaban and winds up in Barty Jr's cell with Sirius Black next door. Barty is convinced the Dark Lord gifted him with Harry to raise as his Prince. Sirius just wants to raise his godson. The Dementors enjoy the drama. An unlikely friendship, and an even more unlikely family, forms!

She was already facing him, fearless even though he could see anxiety lingering in her gaze. Without thinking, he turned to his side, and reached out a hand, taking hers and lifting it to his mouth. He kissed her knuckles, giving himself a moment.What did he think? He thought of his childhood, loving but lonely at times. He thought of Petunia, who Lily spoke of sadly and bitterly, and of Regulus, who Sirius never spoke of at all, and of Sirius himself, who was James’ constant companion as he grew. He thought of Harry, and how his heart burst every time his son said I love you.

What does the boy who lived have left to lose?For reasons Draco Malfoy would probably never understand Harry Potter had saved him from Azkaban. The Boy Who Lived had, of his own accord, convinced the Winzengamot that Draco was forced to act as he did to save his own life and so was not deserving of a prison sentence. Rather, he was deserving of a second chance. As a result, Draco finds himself returning to Hogwarts, forced to spend every moment of his time with Potter who, even more curiously, agreed to personally watch over Draco. As if he couldn't be anymore inconvenient Potter is annoyingly determined to figure out what Draco went through whilst sharing his home with Voldemort and his most devoted followers. Draco just wants to know why Potter saved him.(In progress and under editing)

Remus Lupin is a shy, nerdy Welshman studying photography at university. Their lives were pretty normal until life as they knew it changed. When Remus just happened to walk into the pub in which a certain raven-haired man was performing, neither of them knew that it would be the most important event in their story together...

When Blizzard's injury flares up at the beginning of the Lions-Rangers game, the whole team's a little thrown, but no one more than Leo, who ends up unexpectedly thrust into his NHL debut. The Lions lose 4-0, but he carries the weight of the loss stoically, not breaking down until he's alone in his and Logan's hotel room. What he doesn't expect is for Logan to follow. This fic takes place on the same night as Sirius and Remus sleeping together in Remus’s hotel room after the Lions’ loss to the Rangers, and a couple weeks after my fic Alone in the Storm.As always, credit to Lumosinlove for creating these wonderful characters. (This is listed under Harry Potter fandom because it is based on characters by Lumosinlove in their wolfstar hockey au fics Sweater Weather and Coast to Coast.

Harry didn't have time to worry what it meant that he fantasised about blokes because he was too busy worrying why he had begun fantasising about one specific bloke: the unrelenting git Malfoy. Oh yeah, and because someone was trying to kill him again.From two prompts, one given by my brother: ""HP fic where everything is the exact same except Harry Potter is very, very gay"" and prompt #621 from drarrypromptoftheday.tumblr: ""What if Harry's 'Treasure' that was stolen from him, and placed at the bottom of the lake for the second Tri-wizard tournament task, was actually Draco and not in fact Ron?""___JKR has been cancelled. This author wants everyone to know that this is a safe space, trans rights are human rights, terfs will NOT be tolerated, and HP is strictly ours now. Don't let some woman who has fallen for the same folly as her own antagonists ruin the beloved book series or make you doubt yourself. You are loved and supported!

The idea that the Deathly Hallows were given to the Peverell brothers by Death itself comes from The Tales of Beedle the Bard.   When a first-hand account becomes gossip, becomes hearsay, becomes legend, becomes folklore, and is then retold as a children's story, the result is like a pearl.  Any grit of truth lies well concealed under many layers of gloss.The assertion that uniting the Hallows makes one Master of Death comes from the mouth of Xenophilius Lovegood, who also believed in such things as Heliopaths, the Rotfang Conspiracy, and goblin pies.

Ron smells like broomstick handle polish and the oddly generic shampoo scent that Harry's been used to all his life, something clean and soapy, indistinct and easily overlooked. Though Harry doesn't only think of broomstick handle polish and generic shampoo when Ron's around. It's a combination of things, like fried eggs at breakfast and the scent of roasted sausages, treacle tart at The Burrow, and the crisp linen bedsheets of the Gryffindor dorms. It's the citrusy cologne Fred and George give Ron on his birthday, the way Harry inhales deeply when Ron wears it the first time.

“Sleep well, babycakes.” He murmured, fond smugness creeping in when he felt Severus smile slightly at the use of the nickname.

A closely held secret has made the Malfoy bloodline not as pure as the world believes. After skipping several generations, Draco Malfoy gets a nasty shock when he receives a creature-inheritance. Coming to terms with being a half-breed is no easy feat for Draco, and he has to learn to accept exactly what ""unconditional"" love and self-love is. Luckily, and from unexpected sources, it turns out there are people in his life who would rather see him alive and a half-breed than to clean and purify the Malfoy bloodline.___Prompt messaged to me from anonymous: ""You should do a crossover with HP-verse and Grimm-verse, but about wesen in the HP-verse and enemies-to-lovers drarry""Please note: You do *not* need to know or have seen Grimm to read this.*******JKR has been cancelled. This author wants everyone to know that this is a safe space, trans rights are human rights, terfs will NOT be tolerated, and HP is strictly ours now.

Harry Potter was never a wizard. Wizards didn't exist. He grows up with the Dursleys and attends Stonewall High, where he becomes close friends with a boy with anger issues, who's a great friend when he's not in an angry mood. Even with a warm bed  and maybe a  real home at Stonewall, he still has his own issues to deal with, involving many truly troubled bullies and feelings he never thought he'd experience.

Minerva McGonagall makes a single decision. One large, split second choice to help a small child grow up loved. He'll be fine with this other family. Old acquaintances of hers. They're all but used to magic anyways.And if there's anything odd about the boy from his experiences with You-Know-Who? Well, the entire family is a bit peculiar.

Ginny is in the bathtub scrolling through Instagram when she receives the news. She’d almost forgotten about that she’d even auditioned and she certainly hadn’t been expecting to hear back when she had. Fred and George had helped her make the tape over spring break but none of them had taken it very seriously. The advertisement that they’d seen on Facebook was so inconspicuous and unofficial-looking that it hadn’t seemed to warrant any degree of commitment and the resulting tape was a bundle of jump cuts and overly ironic captions and almost-meta one-liners set to an instrumental pop version of “Welcome to the Black Parade”. In other words, it was a mess. But they’d sent it in, all three of them laughing about it for all of five minutes before collectively putting it out of their minds.  The Sonny With a Chance AU that literally only I wanted

It all started with a blond strand of hair. From there, all Harry Potter has known about his life begins to unravel as he finds out the truth about his past and who he is, unearthing secrets that he didn't believe possible and finding family he didn't know existed. But maybe these changes could be a new beginning, a blessing in disguise, if he looks at it the right way.

The one born as the seventh month ends, with parents who have thrice defied him, will have the power to vanquish the Dark Lord. Only, Lord Voldemort can't be sure which boy the prophecy is foretelling to be his downfall. Lily and James Potter will do anything to keep their son safe, as will Alice and Frank Longbottom. Hidden away from the rest of the world, who already live in daily fear of what the war will bring down onto their doorstep next. Everyone wants to keep their loved ones safe from harm, but it isn't so easy when they themselves are powerless, and those loved ones almost just as much. And the Dark Lord will go to any length for the power he craves, to put an end to this prophecy. What will reign in the end? How much bloodshed will there have to be before the War is won?

Neither of them had thought much about moving across the country until Sirius suggested it and Remus had agreed. Not because Remus didn’t like home or was itching for a change, but because he’d follow Sirius anywhere and Portland had just sounded right, the way you can gauge the vibe of a place without ever having been. Home is a four letter word, just like love or fuck (essential parts of Remus Lupin’s vocabulary) and Remus thinks that home is wherever Sirius ends up, so they pack their things and embark on their next great adventure: conquering the Pacific Northwest.

Lukas Potter is the boy who lived.
Amaryllis Potter is the girl who survived.
Harry Potter is the boy who died. 
Two are loved, one is hated. 
Lukas defeated Voldemort.
Amaryllis survived his attack.
Harry was killed by him.
And yet, at the end of the day, all three children are alive and well... and so is Voldemort. And their mother is dead. 
James lavishes all of his attention onto his older two children, completely ignoring Harry and even going so far as to send him off to a Muggle boarding school. Harry grows up in fear and pain, while his older siblings grow up spoiled and conceited, being told that they are necessary for the Dark Lord to be defeated again. 
When they all reunite at Hogwarts, they are startled to see what they've become. Amaryllis is completely and totally convinced of her superiority, Lukas is terrified of the Dark Lord and hiding it under a mask of superiority, and Harry is beaten, shy, and quiet. Yet little Harry is the most powerful of them all-and the most injured. 
Where will they go from here?

The Latest Shitpost:
(Batman / DCU)When Tim starts coughing up a second type of flower, they legitimately think they’re going to die. They barely have enough space to breathe with one set of roots in their bronchial tubes; how the hell are they going to survive two?Naturally, Robin panics when Tim randomly starts coughing up red flower petals in the middle of their ice cream run. Tim waves him off and pokes at the wad of flora they’d spit into their napkin. Unlike the plumerias, this new flower seems to have thinner petals, like a daisy. Interesting. Troublesome, but interesting.Being distracted with the new flower petals means they’re almost too slow to stop Robin from calling the ambulance on them.

The Shrieking Shack was a large, creaking building, filled with spiders and mice. It was cold, and dark, and some corners were eternally damp, though there was no running water. The roof had holes, and some of the windows were smashed out, others missing the glass panes completely. There were rooms where the floor wasn’t worth the risk, and others where the draft was so bad Sirius refused to go inside unless he was wearing his fur coat.It was so unlike Hogwarts, a pervasive feeling of pain and suffering, the slight stinging smell of blood. The magic there wasn’t exciting or happy like the halls of the school—it was confining, sad, an afterthought. It wasn’t a place to experiment, a place with no consequences.Sirius loved it.----written for the prompt, ""Making a goofy face until they notice and laugh""

Avery Wilkes, Ministry of Magic employee at the administrative section of the Improper Use of Magic Office, has come across a lead to a magical artefact that even those in the Wizarding World consider lost or destroyed at best, and complete hogwash at worst. He is determined to get to the bottom of it, especially when he learns that he isn't the only one interested.

Later, Harry would wonder if Malfoy regretted that first, surprised mutter after three days of hard-pointed silence. Later, Harry would wonder about his own lack of regret over looking up when he heard Malfoy’s voice. But that would come after everything had already happened, the way events always seemed to, when even a Time-Turner couldn’t change things. The shape of a path, as Harry knew very well by then, once walked, was a lot like a paper crane — unfolded and pressed flat, you could try to fashion it into something different, but the original creases would always remain.

Hermione was miserable. She didn't even get the chance to say goodbye, and now he was gone; but Fate seems to have other plans for her. He is still there and he's coming back, for her._-_-_-_-_-_Extract:Severus Snape was dead. He had looked Harry in the eyes one last time, giving him his most painful memories and then he had passed out, like the weak flame of a burnt out candle. Severus Tobias Snape had died in a pool of blood surrounded by dust and darkness and Hermione had cried. She had cried all her tears. They were stupid tears: Professor Snape had never noticed the light in her eyes every time he spoke. How to blame him. She had only been a student. An insufferable know it all. It wasn't the comments that had hurt her, it was that they were all true and they came from him. Hermione hadn't lost faith in him. She had never lost faith in anyone._-_-_-_-_-_Light angst at the beginning and then fluff and SMUT. Enjoy.

A follow on from a forbidden encounter behind a dungeon tapestry. 

She bit her lower lip and rubbed her legs together again, the fabric of her skirt feeling particularly abrasive today. Possibly because she was overheated and sweating, legs sticking to the uncomfortable chair. Evidently there was a heating issue in the usually crisp library. How was no one else hot? A quick, surreptitious glance at the neighbouring desks revealed a motley of house scarves and jumpers masquerading as students. Preposterous.


She fanned at her face, sure her cheeks were bright red. She gripped her quill tighter, smearing ink and almost cracking the delicate shaft as her traitorous brain turned yet again to hot breath against her cheek, and the curl of a tongue around her index and middle finger.

James and Lily have just been told that their little boy may be destined to end the war his parents have been fighting in for years. Neither of them takes it well.

Starting after the events of Prisoner of Azkaban and ending before the beginning of the Half-Blood Prince, this is a retelling of all the events in between, from Remus Lupin and Sirius' Black's POVs. What happens when you date someone at school, break up, and then, like, don't see them for twelve years due to the fact that one of you was framed for murder and treason and the other one believed it? Hijinks, probably. Anyways, they're falling in love all over again, or maybe they never fell out, but now that they are older, now that Harry is a part of their lives, now that all their lives are constantly in danger, how will this affect their feelings and actions?

When Hagrid ends the shopping trip, Harry promises to go on his own.""I've lived with...mundanes,"" Harry says, stumbling over the other word he's heard some wixen (another word he's heard during this trip) use for muggles, and it feels far less offensive, ""I can get home by myself, I just want to see a bit more of Diagon Alley, if that's alright? You said it's perfectly safe.""Hagrid hums and haws, but eventually he yields. Perhaps if the mystery package wasn't burning a hole in his pocket he wouldn't have caved so easily, but thankfully he does.When Harry is alone with his purchases (thank whatever Gods wixen worship that he has shrunk, light weight magiced bags) and the owl, he mulls over what to do first.

Wandr was born, and Draco wants to join. The only problem is, in a world where everyone's cock has a different flavor, not listing yours on your profile is as good as shouting that you're a virgin.

It’s the scent of Albus, familiar and intoxicating and surrounding him. It’s the reassuring feel of their bodies moving against each other. It’s the safe, strong embrace of Albus’s arms and the thrill of the small noises he makes, the subtle sighs and moans. 

Albus is late home from work, Scorpius is waiting up for him. It's pitch black, they're a bit sleepy, and very much in love.

Disappearances plague the wizarding world and not even Hogwarts is safe from the sinister forces at play. When a group of transfer students from America show up in Hogwarts who seem to know their way around a blade and have the knowledge to defeat creatures from Greek mythology, Harry, Hermione and Ron find themselves allying with the Americans to try and solve the disappearances of the wizards and witches.When a trip to the forbidden forest goes haywire, the demi-gods are left reeling, becoming wary of who they can trust. As a Demi-god comes to terms with the loss of their magic, the demi-gods race to reveal the true prophecy as their magic weakens but as the demi-gods begin to go missing, they realize their task might need some help. With a threat of a spy amongst the demi-gods, they find themselves allying with Harry and his friends to find out the mystery behind the disappearing wizards and witches.While the demi-gods scramble to find the true prophecy, Harry, Hermione and Ron try to solve why hellhounds are in the forbidden forest, leading them to a startling discovery.""Fate has terrible power. You cannot escape it by wealth or war. No fort will keep it out, no ships outrun it"" - Sophocles.

To my knowledge I’ve never had a sister.”Instead of settling Harry, this made him suddenly turn on Sherlock, stepping closer, his eyes intent as he peered into Sherlock’s. “Have you ever been obliviated?”

For a long time, the only friends' Harry had were the spiders under the stairs and the snakes in the garden. He could talk to them and they would listen. Sure, it was freakish and made the Dursely's hit him when they caught Harry doing it, but it was the only kindness he really had. (Figg didn't count since she was only babysitting him and would never be against the Dursely's.)The addition of a zoo animal didn't mean much more than a new friend.

Draco could grab Potter and shove him into a stall before proceeding to suck his soul out of his dick, but secretly, deep down, in the part of Draco that he will never admit to anyone, he is (everyone pauses to shudder) a romantic. Potter is not someone Draco wants a one-off with. Potter is — Draco’s beloved!
So Draco decides to boldly go where no one has gone before: to put himself through scrutiny; their friends’ teasing and pranks; unsound romantic advice from a house-elf; wearing pretty clothes; all to try and win Potter’s heart through courtship.
(An unnamed ginger bastard can be heard yelling from afar: “This is actually a detailed guide on how not to court someone!”)
But who cares about the opinions of redheads? Literally no one.

Oakley Hawthorne was born a Muggle. A boring, ordinary Muggle. He lived in a Muggle neighborhood with Muggle parents and had Muggle friends. He wanted anything but to be normal. He wanted adventure. He wanted things that his small, bland neighborhood could not offer him.How curious it is when an old book is found to be in his possession... a book talking of things not of his world. A book of magic— dark magic. A book, he thinks, that has the power to change the course of his future forever and alter his soul in a way that cannot be undone. Will Oakley ignore the darkness spilling from the book's pages? Or will he succumb to the pull of something beyond his control— the very precious and unordinary chance of a lifetime?

Hermione hears Lavender and Parvati talking about how Trewlaney told them that dreams had prophetic features. And how they fantasized about their dreams about boys coming true. She of course dismisses them because she does not believe in divination.Then, that night she has a really weird dream, with a brand new muggle song she now can't get out of her head. Except, she only remembers two lines “You'll always be a part of me, I'm part of you indefinitely, Boy don't you know you can't escape me?” and she's both creeped and frustrated from them. She simply can't get the words out of her head. Then, an accidental spell hits her and she keeps hearing those words everytime she thinks of Harry.

The one thing out of place this year was that Malfoy and him weren’t butting heads as usual. If anything, Malfoy seemed to be actively trying to avoid Harry for a while now. He missed every single game against Gryffindor, he sat at the back of the class at Potions. He always asked for the most random hours to do his rounds as prefect, which never coincide with his. There was also a lack of hostility towards any of Harry’s friends.Draco Malfoy seemed to be a shadow of himself. And that bothered Harry. OrThe thing about Harry was that sometimes he could be a little dense. As Hermione so often reminded him, he was witty and resourceful at a moment's notice or in dire situations, but he could also be painfully slow to notice things that were right under his nose.

""As they were both walking back towards wizarding London at the end of the day, Astoria had asked if he was free the very next day - she knew it was technically ‘his turn’ to arrange a date, but she’d already made plans to go to what she called a ‘Farmer’s Market’ in the morning, and she very much wanted him to come along. Draco didn’t have plans - he never had plans, really, except for work, as he’d distanced himself from most of his old friends after the war - and although he had no idea what a Farmer’s Market was, he’d agreed on the spot.""If anyone’s in the market (pun 100% intended) for some fluffy Malfoy fam feels (and hunger pangs!), I’ve written three lil’ drabbles inspired by Draco’s third greatest love.Featuring cheese toasties, cheeky smiles, sweet stalls and sticky buns - and no plot whatsoever.

Harry isn’t the Boy-Who-Lived, but his parents still died, and Albus Dumbledore, concerned that Death Eaters might seek the boy’s death, cast a powerful charm on him to make wizards ignore him before Harry was left with the Dursleys. Except, with the Elder Wand in play, the charm was far too powerful, and made others essentially forget Harry existed when not directly interacting with him. Sorted into Ravenclaw at Hogwarts, Harry lives a contented life with no one either loving or hating him…until the charm breaks on his seventeenth birthday, and he’s suddenly plunged directly into the middle of a living world at war.

Tom, being a goody-two-shoes, approached his afterlife the same way he did with Hogwarts: by being the best. However, what he doesn't realize is that the only way to graduate from the school is to be forgiven by his mentor.A series of ficlets based on @Minryll’s art.

Harry Potter has honestly enjoyed his four years as a Gryffindor. He loves the friends, the camaraderie, the cozy feeling of Gryffindor Tower – oh, and getting to be the Boy-who-Lived, wizarding superstar, isn't bad either. The House of Lions helped him to become the friendly, warm, fun-loving kid he is today – and set aside his past as the terror of Little Whinging Primary, the cold, angry boy who hurt Muggles with magic.But it's not that simple. He hates being in danger every year. He hates the way he underperforms in classes. He can't quite let go of the manipulative ways of his childhood, still lurking beneath the surface. And after watching Lord Voldemort murder Cedric Diggory, he's absolutely petrified. He wants out. He wants to stop being Harry Potter.When the wards protecting Harry fail, Professor Dumbledore offers him the chance to go into hiding: to adopt a new name and a new face, placed with the family of an Order member so he can return to Hogwarts incognito. Harry accepts, and lets his childhood self come rushing back in the persona of the cunning, dark, and ever so Slytherin Miss Iolanthe Snape.She finds it all too easy to change. The question is, will she ever want to change back?

 “You know my name.” he said slowly. “Don’t you?”
“Heard of… the magic genius… after the Blizzard?” Harry heard his sword clatter to the floor. The colors were blending together. Harry blinked thrice, looking at the ceiling and back at Voldemort’s face. 
Then it clicked. He had been attacked by a man who had studied and mastered magic in less than two decades. 
“I’m not gonna get paid enough for this… am I now?”
Harry is a witcher, a monster slayer for hire who goes all around the country exchanging his services for coin. Tom is a brilliant mage in the Slytherin District with a mean streak, an awful history of mood swings and the potential to take over the whole country if he saw fit.Even if he can't remember the first eighteen years of his existence, at least Harry could still understand the concept of witchers primarily working alone. It was a little unfortunate that Tom, for all his intelligence, couldn't grasp such a thing.Well, at least Harry would now have company whenever he gets himself kidnapped or maimed.

Draco's heard the rumours, of course, of Potter being starved as a child. Maybe that's why he seems to be perpetually hungry. Unlike Draco, who can easily forget to eat or drink — or sleep, for that matter — when he's working on an assignment. Maybe he should see it as a blessing, being partnered with someone who'll always make sure they're properly fed, but... it's Potter, for Circe's sake! Surely, being partnered with Potter can never count as a blessing?

“I’ve missed you so much,” Hermione whispered in the crook of his neck, a few tears running down her cheeks, wetting the skin of his neck. “I was so worried.”“Shhh, it’s okay,” Draco assured her, running his large hands down her hair. “I’m safe, I’m home now.”Draco has been away on a mission for the resistance longer than expected.

My friend saw a post online about Harry being adopted by the Addams family. Considering how amazing and supportive Gomez and Morticia are of their children, it would be expected that their love would extend to Harry. 
In this scenario Gomez keeps breaking into Hogwarts grounds so that he can watch Harry's quidditch matches. No one is really sure how he keeps doing it, but Harry is just happy to see his dad.  
I just want our boy to be happy.

When all the political attacks don’t seem to work Tom Riddle decides to hit Dumbledore where it hurts the most- (no not the crotch, not yet, though he thought about it)-and take Hogwarts. Only, certain students are more intuitive then they should be, Tom is actually not bad at the whole teaching gig and Gryffindors keep causing trouble.Or: the one where Tom Riddle is just that passionate about teaching and Severus Snape is just a little less bitter but no less in pain.

Telling him his hair was done, he leaned back again, resting his head on my lap. “I’m ready to head up to bed, wanna sleep?” He asked me in the most seductive voice he could, to which Peter let out an obvious groan over his homework. Even in the common room Sirius will never resist a good chance to flirt. When Peter asked us to at least ‘do it quick’, I can only assume my boyfriend winked when he replied, “no promises.” Peter has no idea. Sirius stood and grabbed me by the hand, practically yanking me upstairs to the bedroom. Once in the privacy of the room, I remarked, “You know you don’t have to pretend around James and Peter, they’re literally our best friends.”

I chose Hannah Abbott Longbottom, and the passing down of an heirloom necklace, as hers. This story was also written as a gift for one of my young friends, Emz on the HPFF site.

Harry has never been the most observant bloke. Sometimes to the point of him not realising his feelings for a particular pointy, pale git. And it's not his fault if literally everyone else knows about said feelings except for Harry and the git in question. So it's really not his fault, when faced with the scope of his feelings, he suddenly has a hard time talking to one Draco Malfoy. Or looking him in the eye. Or not being a total weirdo around him.There's nothing to do but take the advice of his friends and try to woo Draco over dinners with friends, Ministry cases, and an unfortunately named Italian restaurant. Harry just can't stop the flutter in his chest when he sees Draco smile.

As an added task in the Maze, each champion must brew a potion before moving on to the next stage where they meet the rest of the maze occupants. Now they can brew anything they think could help them.  But Harry Potter is not good at potions, so he has no idea what to brew or how.  So he decides to just brew what smells like it goes together like he does when he cooks, so he just hopes for the best. AU of course.  Just something that popped into my head today and I had to write it.

'Draco,’ Hermione crooned, making her voice sound as soothing as possible. She reached up to wrap her hands in his soft blond hair, tugging firmly to try and force him to look down at her. His hands were holding her tight around her waist, almost meeting around her middle, but he looked over her head to where the official was now lying sprawled on his back. ‘Look at me, Draco,’ she tried again, tugging his hair harder. 	Finally he tore his eyes away and looked down at her, still breathing heavily. Hermione gasped when she saw the usual silver of his irises had brightened to an ethereal blue, his pupils narrowed into elongated slits.	‘Oh, Draco…’ she breathed, concern building in her as she reached up to stroke his cheek. Draco purred and rubbed his face against her palm. ‘We need to get you home.’

Then this year he nearly died due to lupin being a werewolf and him foolishly following Blacks advice to follow him and find out for himself. The worst part is Dumbledore threatened time expel him if he told any one! He didn’t even give black detention for nearly killing him and he gets threatened to be expelled?! How could this all get worse well... now he has to deal with the fact that Avery and Mulciber messed up a potion in class and then spilt it on him turning him into a bloody women?! Now he has to wear a glamor to cover it up and wait until they find a way to undo it! until then he’s stuck as a girl...

We all know Harry was not exactly filled with knowledge or given anything that could actually help him in his controlled life.  So what would happen if Harry finally saw that he was just a tool, left in a cold dark shed? What would happen if he wanted answers? Why was his life so carefully controlled? He couldn’t be the only tool in the shed right?

Appetence: defined as an attraction, a natural affinity, or an instinctive desire. In other words, it's a cosmic sort of bond that clouds the mind until all thought is consumed by that singular point of infatuation. When Voldemort divines what Harri Potter truly means to him all those years ago in the graveyard, a festering obsession begins. His horcrux. A part of his wayward soul, crafted from his marrow, magic, and might— his very own damning appetence. He knows what has been kept from him, what rightfully belongs at his side, and now? Well. Now, he wants her back.

Hermione and Draco are partners on an Arithmancy project during their eighth year, but Draco fails to meet up at their agreed upon time. When Hermione finds him down at the Quidditch pitch, she just might change her mind about how upset she is. ""She hadn't seen him up close in his Quidditch kit since second year, and the sight made her snap her jaw shut and swallow. Her eyes trailed from his massive hands and his covered forearms up to his square shoulders. His emerald green robes fit over his light pads snuggly and hung like a second skin down his slim torso. Quidditch robes were designed to be trim, without excess fabric, for speed and agility, and Hermione was reaping the benefits of that now.At the waist, the robes parted to showcase the tight trousers he wore to cover his lower half. The white fabric almost glowed in the twilight, and shadows at his groin left little to the imagination as the fabric bunched at his hips, creating an impressive display of his package.He'd slowed down as he approached the locker rooms, and Hermione drank her fill of his body before snapping her eyes up to see his face lit by the lamp at the Slytherin entrance.""

So much. There’s so much that Harry missed, so much he never dared to ask, so much he never knew, never tried to. So many people with their own stories, and we only see them from Harry’s (admittedly) imperfect perspective? That hardly seems fair. Nothing is ever so one-sided as it appears. We judge these flawed characters, yet we never try to understand them. Let’s try.

“What’s the height difference like, when it comes to sex?” Ginny waggled her eyebrows suggestively. 
  Feeling eyes on her neck, Hermione looked up to find Draco staring at her from across the room. He appeared to be multitasking; while chatting amiably with Harry, he was also sending her a secret message with his gaze, another psychic missive detailing how her dress, lovely as it was, would look much better on his bedroom floor.  “You know I don’t kiss and tell.” Hermione lifted her chin and fluffed her hair, grinning like the cat that got the cream. “But it does have … certain advantages.”*A fluffy, funny, filthy smut-biscuit written for Musyc's Dramione Height Difference Mini-Fest 2020 and featuring a tol!Hermione and a smol!Draco*

Lord Voldemort and Harry Potter have married -- not out of love but out of duty, as part of a negotiation that gives each of them something they want. Harry's adjusting to the marriage and his husband's rather dominating personality as quickly as he can, ever the chameleon when something he cares about is on the line, but no adjustment is perfect. Even as he finds things he likes not everything is simple and the people in Harry's life -- his found family sister, Hermione; his erstswhile former guardians, Sirius and Remus; his other friends from Hogwarts like Neville and Luna and Theo Nott -- aren't making things simpler. Of course, in the end, Harry's the one that's likely to complicate things most of all. Disrupting plans is sort of what he does. Note: This is the third in a series and follows an AU world where Voldemort was resurrected in 2nd year as Tom Riddle.

After a rather distressing end to her first year at Hogwarts, Jamie returns home for the summer to deal with homework, friendships and the occasional nightmare, hoping her second year at school will be more peaceful. But a peaceful year doesn't look to be in store when news of a prison break hits the wizarding world. Now she must face a whole new year of adventures, exploration, learning, and that one stray dog she keeps seeing around the forest.I genuinely don't know how to do summaries but basically, if you haven't read Canis Minor (part 1) none of this story is gonna mean much. So do go read that, it's the first part of the ""Black Night Sky"" series.Join us in watching Jamie grow to be the sassy little shit she was destined to become in this next part of her story. There will be pranks, there will be adventuring and there will be a werewolf who is just trying his best to do his job. There will also be plenty more Buckbeak love than the original book had.

After finishing his Ministry-ordered probation, Draco had to decide on a ""new life path"", whatever that meant. He wasn't sure the judge knew what that meant. What it sounded like was a farce. How was he supposed to decide on a new future when he still hadn't come to terms with the past? Enter Hermione Granger in all her Ministry glory. As an employee of the Ministry's Department of Magical Law Enforcement, it became her job to ensure that Draco did what he was supposed to do: find a new career path, and disavow everything that his family had stood for. As he tried to piece himself back together, and put distance between himself and his family values, he found himself wanting to be closer to Granger, who wanted nothing to do with him. [hiatus]

You would have never guessed that 15 years later you’d return to Hogwarts, commissioned to paint each faculty member’s portrait, and be reunited with Remus Lupin as the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

Three years after graduating Hogwarts, Harry, Ron, and Hermione have basically dropped off the map. Harry turned down a job in the Auror Office and Hermione ignored several apprenticeship offers. Ron was the only one to take a job in the Ministry, working in the same department as his father. However, they've been far busier than any outsider account could say. And so the Golden Trio follows in their headmaster's footsteps, founding an underground organization to rival the threat of the Order of the Clock Tower and change Wizarding Britain for the better. --“Even the current minister, Kingsley Shacklebolt, is considered progressive for doing very little in the way of equality. His hands are tied by bureaucracy and politics.” Hermione smiled wider. “Mine, however, are not.”Chuuya leaned forward then. “You haven’t answered my question, Hermione,” he pointed out. “You’ve been asking the wrong questions.”

AU. Story of Sirius Black. A dark boy from a dark family, but what if his family was a little darker than we thought? What if he were Voldemort's son? This is basically a Marauders era fic mostly written pre-Order of the Phoenix (with some edits to acknowledge the later books).  It's Sirius-centric, but just gives what was a possible, albeit unlikely take back when we only had four books to work with.  Please give it a shot, and review, so I know how to improve as I move forward with this story.  Thanks! :D

Hope watches with surprise as Quidditch Captain Guy spots Remus. He dashes forward, throws an arm over Remus’s shoulder and ruffles his hair. Remus just laughs, happy and carefree, and playfully tries to push him away. As Remus tries to get his hair back in order, the other guy turns to his handsome friend. When Hope sees the handsome friend’s face, she suddenly thinks that he might have an interest in romance stuff after all, as his expression can only be described as lovestruck. Then the good-looking high school heartthrob is standing in front of her son.
 Hope Lupin and Euphemia Potter are good mums.Hope Lupin has never truly stopped worrying about her son fitting in at school. She never expected him to get along with the popular kids. She never expected him to be friends with the popular kids. And she never, ever, expected the most popular boy in school to look at her son like that.Euphemia Potter wants her sons, biologically or not, to be happy. And what would make Sirius happy has suddenly become very obvious.

The Hanahaki Disease, it read, is a curse that would cause its victims to discharge flowers through their mouth in the presence and when thinking of someone they love romantically, and who they believe would never be able to return their feelings. While this curse may not seem harmful at first, if left untreated, the afflicted would be forced to give up their life to the curse due to blood loss and suffocation through how the vines wrap around the victims' heart. Sirius had known this since he was eleven, eagerly expecting Hogwarts. He just hadn’t expected Remus to consume his life so utterly.

I was two years younger when I started writing this version of the story, and that becomes apparent with each chapter, as the later ones are much better than the first one. Nevertheless, this is my first finished fanfic. I can look back on this and compare my writing then to my writing now and in the future. I am not deleting this again. I say this so whoever reads this might be aware—any complaints you have about the story or the writing, I agree. And in a moment of shameless self-promotion, may I interest you in my other works? They're much better.

He hadn’t planned on there being a Tomorrow, after the Battle. He didn’t know what to think when he opened his eyes and saw the pale yellow curtains of the infirmary. He didn’t know what to think when he saw Hermione Granger slumped over in a chair next to him, dark circles under her eyes and looking very old for her seventeen years. He didn’t know what to think when he saw a copy of the Prophet in her lap, announcing the defeat of the Dark Lord. He particularly didn’t know what to think when she opened her eyes and gazed at him with apparent relief. “At least that’s one thing I’ve done right,” she whispered. She was so forlorn and sad. “I should have known better than to assume the worst of you, sir.” He might not have known what to think, but he knew what to do: pretend this had been his plan all along. Pretend he’d wanted to survive. Pretend he hadn’t been passively resigned, allowing the gods to determine his fate.   Pretend he wasn’t shocked that someone had cared enough to come back for him.

Hermione gasped as the cold rain instantly drenched her.‘I have an idea,’ he said quietly, ‘but I don’t think you’re going to like it.’

When a Voldemort in his thirties encounters a time-travelling, seventeen-year-old Harry Potter, he makes a dangerous—and hilarious—assumption. He assumes that Harry is his son. And his son, of course, deserves the very best.A confused Harry plays along for the sake of self-preservation, but living with his “father” is proving to be intolerable in more ways than one.
“You are mine,” Voldemort said gently, and smiled when Harry flinched. So the boy did know Voldemort, after all. He knew Voldemort was to be feared. “I will look after you, my own.”
“I don’t belong to you,” Harry spat, despite his fear. Oh, what a delight he was! He was no cowering, simpering sycophant, like Voldemort’s other followers; no, this child had a spine of steel. Not many could stand before Voldemort without quailing.
“You are my son,” Voldemort declared. “Of course you belong to me. Your every cell, your every fibre, your every heartbeat. You are mine in flesh and blood and soul. You are mine in magic. And you will not deny me.”
Now with Chinese, Korean and Portugese translations, and featuring art by Mona and Hypnodisc!

Scorpius has been fine without him, however, and there's no reason for him to complain about anything in his ordinary, simple, and content life.Right?

It's been five years since Jane (Hermione Granger) woke up not knowing who or where she was. She has no memories of her past, no memories at all, except for one-a memory involving the colour blue. It's a specific blue that flashes in her mind almost constantly. She is connected to that shade more than anything else; it brings her peace, calmness. It reminds her of home. One day, during a trip to help reclaim her memory, she thinks she finds the owner of her blue; his eyes are the exact hue that dances in her memories. Will this mysterious stranger lead her to her identity? More importantly, will he reunite her with her missing piece-the one she cannot remember she is missing?

Finally Lux was strong enough to try to resume her life or so she thought. 
But after failing to adjust her old routine, she recognized she needed help. Only then pursuing a permit of absence to leave her position at the Ministry of Magic to take care of her mental and emotional health, she realized that she needed more time just to heal. 
And as if a gift sent from the Gods themselves an unexpected invitation from her first mentor appeared. She was inviting Lux to take up one of the teaching chairs at Hogwarts. The idea seemed to illuminate the path in front of her; this new step would be a very different take in her life. 
Even knowing all the difficulties she would face, the possibility of experiencing another reality and even perhaps a new future was too tempting for her to deny herself of finally fulfilling one of her biggest dreams. 
The dream of becoming a teacher. 
What she didn't expect is that her world would be shaken, her heart taken and her life turned upside down. She had so much… Too much… At stake. After all she knew it was wrong, she knew it would be impossible and she did her best to put barriers between them. 
But she never met anyone like Lena.

Laying in Sirius’s four poster, I couldn’t help but let my mind wander back to our conversation earlier in the week. Isn’t it wrong of me to let him keep on hiding and pretending, if James could accept what I am he would have no problem accepting something as simple as Sirius’s sexuality. I know it’s not up to me, but if it was totally up to my boyfriend he would probably never tell his practical brother. Now or never, right? “Hey Pads,” I questioned, knowing he wasn’t asleep yet. He gave a small hum in response, far too comfortable from me spooning him. Though of course he would probably hex anyone who said it, he can’t pretend with me that he doesn’t absolutely adore feeling safe, and safe for him is being held by those he loves. Whether it be James hugging him after winning a Quidditch match, or Peter slinging his arm around him in the hallways, or me spooning him in our his bed, he’s always so much more at ease than any other time I’ve seen him. “I want to continue our conversation from the other day.”—Or Remus confronts Sirius about hiding his sexuality from James

Draco is a man taught to live one way. His certain traditions, specific desires, and set expectations often veil his soft heart, with the exception of one person. 
Hermione is a girl who has been sheltered away, safely hidden in a soft, pampered world, only to be trained to serve perhaps the most vile desires their twisted world has to offer.
When Draco becomes her owner, he not only promises to protect his little girl, but also unknowingly commits to having his life turned upside down by her. As she blossoms under his care, Hermione soon realizes that nothing, not even the man before her or the life she once knew, is as clear as it seems. Together, they navigate the broken world around them.

""Why do you care so much, Granger?""The pain and disbelief in his voice made him seem younger. She closed the distance between them and laid a hand on his arm. ""Because you didn't have a choice.

Sirius did not expect the stranger to be this strong (or maybe he should have, but didn’t have the time). They grabbed Sirius and changed their positions, so Sirius was pushed against a tree with enough force to knock some fruit down. The stranger pushed their forearm against his throat. Not enough pressure to suffocate him, but enough to keep him down and afraid. Sirius noticed that, even this close, he could not see the stranger’s face. He must be wearing a mask underneath that cloak. Or maybe it’s enchanted. After the longest minute of Sirius’ life, the stranger eased the stress on his throat but did not let go. “What do you want?” “You’re looking for something and I can help you,” Sirius rushed.  After the Great Wizarding War, the Black family escaped to a deserted island for twenty years. No one has ever left, until Sirius Black escapes with a stranger, a flying broomstick, and three pounds of aconite.

When Pansy Parkinson had seen Harry Potter in the middle of the great hall she hadn’t meant to scream for someone to grab him. She didn’t want Potter to die, not really. But standing there, next to her family, her brain went into overload and all she could think was “save lives.” And if that meant one person died to save everyone else then so be it. She wasn’t a monster. She didn’t have some vindictive agenda against Potter personally. She wasn’t even a Death Eater. She was just a girl. A girl who had watched her childhood best friend nearly kill himself over a true monster, the same monster currently trying to break into her school and kill the friends she loved so desperately she considered them the only true family she had left.

This is a collection a slice of life style one-shots about Harry growing up with ADHD and parents who love and support him. It's mostly based on my experience of growing up with ADHD so don't take it as a universal description of what ADHD is like because everybody experiences it differently. Also some of the positivity in this fic might be a bit unrealistic, I tried not to get too idealistic but ADHD life is so hard so I wanted to write something that was uplifting and could provide comfort for those of us who've had bad experiences. From a non ADHD stand point, this fic is about Lily and James Potter raising their ridiculous son, and will include things like first day of school, and getting into mischief and making friends in the halfblood community. Also stuff about like wizard society and the halfblood life.If anybody is reading this and thinking ""this is me"" feel free  to come chat with me and ask questions.

All day I could not stop thinking about what I overheard last night. I mean, I only heard Remus say something about coming out before I spoke up. It’s not like I was trying to eavesdrop, in my defense I thought they heard me walk into the bedroom. How was I supposed to know they were having a deep conversation?But it still doesn’t make any sense! Why would Remus be talking about coming out, he already came out as bisexual to all of us, and the entire school knows Sirius is gay. It’s obvious given how much he openly flirts with Remus all the time, as if they’re not already dating.No matter how much I thought about it, I could not understand and curiosity got the best of me. After dinner I found Sirius conveniently alone in our dormitory, which of course I needed to take advantage of, “Pads, I want to start off by saying I wasn’t trying to listen in,” I began, entering the bedroom.— Or James confronts Sirius about his conversation with Remus.

Post-war, Harry needs space. Everything is too much all at once, and time and time again, he finds himself pulling the invisibility cloak over his head, just for a bit of peace. Returning for eighth year is hard, especially when you're considered a war hero, and your name is Harry James Potter. It's just that things go a little wonky when Harry starts following Malfoy, and finds that he can't (or doesn't want to) stop.

Impulse control has never been one of Harry's strengths. ""All right,"" he says. He tries to justify his decision with a slew of excuses: it can't possibly be that bad, he's doing this for a friend—were they friends?—it'll be fun to have Malfoy owe him one, it's just one night of bodyguarding his favorite rival in the world, what could possibly go wrong—but they all quiet down when Malfoy flashes him a smile. A genuine, truly happy smile. It's gone almost as soon as Harry sees it, but it's branded into his memory. (or, Harry ends up protecting Draco from his many incensed ex-lovers at the St. Mungo's Charity Ball, and shenanigans ensue) inspired by the following exchange from s1e4 of The Witcher on netflix:“how many of these lords want to kill you?""“hard to say. one stops keeping count after a while.”

People from the opposite sides, especially as strong-willed as they are, are bound to hate each other. They certainly do, until one day, differences turn into similarities, and two sides blend into one.

In my Four Great Church-Bells series, the Horsemen are associated with two colors each. Their primary colors, however, match very well with the colors of the Hogwarts Houses, and I decided to think through how a character from Four Great Church-Bells would perceive the Houses.
In short, Hufflepuff is made of children of Famine, all yellow-golds and ignored. Slytherin is filled with children of Pestilence, dreaming impossible fever-dreams of glory. Gryffindor is home to children of War, robed in reds like blood and hemmed in gilt. Finally, Ravenclaw is perch of the children of Death, seeking knowledge the way Icarus sought freedom and just as doomed to go too far and fall.

“I shower after work,” Harry had told him once, when Draco had asked what cologne had such longevity as to be effective after a full day of gruelling Auror work. “For me?” Draco had asked. Teased, just a little. There had been a smile lingering on the edges of his consciousness, threatening to traipse onto his mouth. “For Ginny,” Harry had said, voice flat. “She hates it when I come back sweaty and crackling with other people’s hexes. Did you know magic has a smell? I didn’t, until she told me.”–It's all fun and games, till somebody falls in love. Given his luck, it's obviously Draco who has to go and do it.

Draco's always been drawn to Hermione in some way, he has for years and can't explain. It'd be easier if he could just get a moment alone with her to see why, but she's never alone!At the Yule Ball, Draco finally has a moment with Hermione and they share that time coming to a ""truce"". A battle of brains starts between the two as they form a friendly rivalry to excel in their classes. What started as a ""make Weasley jealous"" game becomes something more, quickly, and with far reaching consequences.With Harry's Triwizard Tournament taking much of the spotlight, and Hermione acting strangely with Malfoy, Ron's jealousy starts manifesting in ugly ways, until it causes a break in school tradition so shocking that people will speak of it for ages to come.A story where Draco finds his redemption at the pivotal moment, deciding that helping keep Harry alive to prevent the resurrection of Voldemort is more important than bitter school rivalries.

Soulmate AUAn anima, the author of the book explained, was someone you had complete affinity with. All magical people had one, a person who would completely get you, fulfil you in a way no other person ever could. They could be family or a close friend, but more often than not people who shared such an intimate connection ended up falling in love. When their magic reached maturity, this connection manifested physically and witches and wizards got a mark in their body to identify their anima.Someone whose soul was completely in tune with yours. The concept far surpassed Hermione’s expectations. To think that there was someone out there who would truly understand her -who would love her as she was. It was an astonishing thought.

Lily stepped out of the hotel, stars in her eyes as she looked up at the night sky in wonder. “Rome is beautiful”, she breathed to herself. 
“The Eternal City… eternally beautiful,” said a voice next to her, causing her to jump. She whipped around to see James walking out of the revolving doors of the hotel. She rolled her eyes. “Well, I guess I can just be glad that Magic for Peace decided to hold their conference here this summer, even if I do have only you for company, Potter,” she said. James merely grinned in response.

At the age of ten, his leather notebook full of ramblings is burned by his aunt. At the age of sixteen, he runs away from a marriage proposal, and falls right through the rabbit hole...Tipped right into wonderland, Harry must deal with a world that has moved on without him, and a Red King who wants him dead.Will he find the murderer and get out of this madhouse, or will he be ever trapped by love?//The beginning is a little similar to ""Into A Land Of Wonder"" by AliceInCandyland and PurpleMango, but it does change!

I’m going bonkers, Harry thinks to himself as he tears through the pile of Muggle pamphlets. He scowls at the titles, things like ‘Foolproof Guide to Losing a Loved One’ or ‘Navigating the Stages of Grief.’ Like another tasteless advert in the Daily Prophet: Muggle Therapist Version.But what can he do? One, he’s desperate for any answer, magical or not. And, two, he’s pretty sure that it is not normal to cope with Sirius’s death accident by hallucinating his dead ex-Death Eater little brother as his personal pet ghost.Which is why, as he checks over his shoulder, he’s hoping really, really hard that the problem is gone. But—“Loath as I am to say it, Potter,” drawls the flickering, irritated spirit of Regulus Arcturus Black, “I’m inclined to believe that we are stuck together. Indefinitely.”…( Or, a foolproof guide to mourning your dead godfather, getting haunted by his dead brother, befriending snakes, smashing lockets, and defeating the Dark Lord in the process. )

Harry takes another step, closer than strictly necessary for cat transferral, but this offers Draco the chance to see that his eyes are actually brilliant green and not the blue he’d once thought.

All of Wizarding Britain suffered in the war, but few suffered more than Hermione Granger. After over a decade away, the brightest witch of her age is returning to England to take a position at Hogwarts. But although Hermione survived the war, she isn't quite the person she once was. While Hermione struggles to find happiness in her new life, some of her most treasured companions struggle to come to terms the ways their old friend has changed. In the end, whether with old friends, old enemies, or new proteges, this fic follows Hermione as she (hopefully) learns that she still has people in her corner, even after all these years.

It's right rotten, being the Boy Who Lived (and Died and Returned to Life, if one wants to get all pedantic) when you have to go back to Hogwarts another year especially, having to deal with everything that has happened and ended, and wondering what is going to begin. If anything will, or can. And then in the spirit of inter-house unity and whatnot, the Headmistress and head of one House seems to disregard seven years of antagonistic behaviour between two particular people and rooms them together.Worse than that, or more work, at least, she has another request.It is all more than Harry James Potter has bargained for.(Or, the time a teaching request was coupled with a Gryffindor-Slytherin room assignment, which forces Harry to be a professor AND dorm mates with Malfoy for a year)  IMPORTANT NOTE: This story deals with issues including past abuse, self-harm, self-loathing, intense reactions/aspects of post traumatic stress disorder, and other possible triggers. Please read responsibly, and take care.

After the fiasco at Hogwarts last year and the previous year, you couldn't help but wonder what sort of problem Hogwarts would face this year. You had a slight inclination: the notorious criminal Sirius Black had escaped from his cell in Azkaban- the most high security wizard's prison out there- and was on the run. You hoped that your last year at Hogwarts would be smooth sailing, but you believed you were getting your hopes up unnecesarily. You were certain you'd face a wide variety of problems your last year; what you didn't know, however, was that one problem would prove to be slightly more 'pleasurable'than the others.

But with the help of his friends, Harry is quite sure that he'll be able to make it through another year relatively unscathed.Oh, and then there's the impending dark resurrection of the high-pitched voice in his head, of course.

Getting grabbed around the ankle at the last second by a screaming Uncle Vernon? Not great.
Kicking Vernon in the face while Fred shouted, “Floor it!”, thus resulting in the Dursley patriarch falling out a window? 
Genuinely a top 10 moment in Harry’s life.
---After dying and being thrown back into his 11 year-old body with limited access to his memories from his past life, Harry's had to get by with only his ever-present sense of deja-vu to keep him from making the same choices (and mistakes) as he did before. But now that he's more connected than ever with his sixth-sense, the barriers that kept his past from him are breaking down. Dreams and visions are bombarding him more frequently, and just in time. The Chamber of Secrets has been opened, and as his deja-vu brain keeps saying, ""It's not happening like it did last time.""

After ten years, golden couple Head Auror Harry Potter and Holyhead Harpies Vice-Captain Ginny Weasley unexpectedly broke up, leaving the Weasley family and gossip columns reeling. But two years later, a chance encounter at a London wizarding bar the week before Ginny's wedding to Neville Longbottom throws the new lives they’ve built without each other into turmoil. As Harry’s career embroils him in a mysteriously new case featuring demons from his past, and Ginny climbs rank at Hollyhead, will these two ever figure out how to fix the hurt they’ve caused each other?A complicated Hinny love story (with poor Neville who’s along for the ride.) Guest-starring Draco Malfoy, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley and Gwenog Jones.

It's getting close to 2 AM, there hasn't been a single arrest brought in tonight, and he's still got another six hours before his shift is over. Rubbing a hand over his face, he prays for something, anything, to make the interminable evening better.

He and Remus will find their way back to each other. They’ll mourn on Halloween and spoil Harry on Christmas and it will be wonderful. Or, on Halloween night of 1981, Sirius Black takes Harry Potter from Godric's Hollow and runs off with him to the other side of the world. Predictably, there are complications.

A life ended in the wrong way, enemies that became family, family that became enemies, and a heart kept safe throughout long years.Excerpt:There was no heart here.Dreams that felt like memories… Green light and long ginger hair… Crying…Or was that him?He felt like he had finally understood something, only to have it disappear, fade before his eyes…Or was it he that had faded?It was odd… These half-memories.  It was almost more like a feeling, like a knowledge he just had but could not recall obtaining.He didn’t feel alone in those memories, evanescent though they were.There was heart there.
