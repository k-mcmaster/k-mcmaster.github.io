Severus wants to submit, he needs to submit, he knows he does.  But if James has it his way, he’d already be balls deep inside of Severus’ with his teeth latched onto his neck.  Severus is his Omega, that’s how it’s supposed to be.  That doesn’t mean that Severus makes it easy for his Alpha or the rest of the pack.  He’s never been an easy Omega which is precisely how he’d managed to hold the Marauders' attention for all these years as they’d engaged in the traditional dance of courtship: stalking him, hounding him, poking and probing him as they forcibly pried each and every one of Severus’ tightly guarded secrets out from under him.  It had been exquisite. , Hello!  This is a one-shot that I created to help get my creative juices flowing while I continue Irrevocably.  Quarantine still has me at my wit's end and I figure smut is a good way of dealing with that :P  I've always been interested in trying my hand at an Omegaverse and after reading my fair share of those sort of stories I have a few different headcanons about Alpha/Beta/Omega dynamics that I've wanted to play with for a while now.

She must navigate through Wizarding high society as Gellert Grindelwald finds power both domestically and overseas. Which side will she choose to fight for, and how will her presence affect the wizarding world? , Hi there! I apologize for the horrendous summary. I decided to write this when I noticed that Cassiopeia Black never married and thought that that was certainly suspicious. I also find the idea behind wandlore fascinating, so I wanted to ~~investigate~~ that a bit more than is done in cannon. Also if Garrick didn't have a child then a 2200+ year near monopoly is going to just dissolve? We can't have that. , Phew. That was a lot of set up. Things will pick up a bit when Ostara heads off to Hogwarts :)Quick note on Knockturn alley- I'm going ahead and assuming that the wealth gap wasn't as dramatic as it was in the 1990s, and Knockturn alley serves as the lower-middle class shopping center. The anti-muggleborn rhetoric, while still present in the 1930s, isn't going to be as venomous as is seen in cannon. Because of this, things like traditional wizarding culture will be more of a point of contention than blood status. Hopefully we'll see over time how the climate changes to bring blood purity as a status symbol. Radicalization doesn't happen overnight- this time period marks the start of the ideals Voldemort & co tout coming to prominence.  This is my first fic so any criticism is more than welcome! Let me know if anything doesn't make sense and I'll try to address it in the coming chapters. Thanks for reading! ",2020-05-06
