“Alpha,” Severus whimpers, and the growl of approval from James causes more wetness to leak from him.  Severus wants to submit, he needs to submit, he knows he does.  But if James has it his way, he’d already be balls deep inside of Severus’ with his teeth latched onto his neck.  Severus is his Omega, that’s how it’s supposed to be.  That doesn’t mean that Severus makes it easy for his Alpha or the rest of the pack.  He’s never been an easy Omega which is precisely how he’d managed to hold the Marauders' attention for all these years as they’d engaged in the traditional dance of courtship: stalking him, hounding him, poking and probing him as they forcibly pried each and every one of Severus’ tightly guarded secrets out from under him.  It had been exquisite.

Jack Potter is born 12 minutes after his twin brother Harry. This is not a large gap, but when fate and prophecies are involved, it might as well be an ocean. He enters the world, not as the seventh month dies, but as the eighth month is born. Officially the Unchosen One; in fate and later in life.Jack is pushed through the British foster care system, with no knowledge of magic, and no knowledge of his twin. It isn’t the worst childhood, but it certainly isn’t the best. We meet him as he meets Professor McGonagall, and everything spirals from there.Includes Draco Malfoy being shouted at, Hermione Granger saving the day (numerous times), and Harry Potter getting a shot at family.

Harry, all things considered, should have expected this. if only for the fact that every achievement and/or good thing to ever happen to him was continuously overshadowed by a very very bad thing. So really, being kidnapped across dimensions was just par for the course in the life of the infamous boy-who-lived.

Intrigued, Fred agrees and the unlikely pair spend the next week meeting up to practice spells after dark. It turns out, Fred isn't nearly as insufferable as Hermione once thought.

When he came of age, he never presented as an Alpha, Beta or an Omega, which wasn’t necessarily uncommon. Everyone had assumed after defeating one of the strongest Alphas ever known, Harry would take up the mantle. But he hadn't. After years of believing he was just someone who hadn't presented, Harry is presenting as an Omega. But something is wrong. He can't hold anything down, he can't seem to get out of a pseudo 'heat'. And his Healer can't help him. So it is time to reach out for a second opinion.

A grown man with ideals and opinions of his own.They both have a desperate need for attention. He to be seen by all, her to be seen by him.

By all accounts, Draco Malfoy should be content with his life. A caretaker of the Wizarding Wild’s rarest, most majestic creatures, he begins and ends every day amid effusion, beauty, and a sense of purpose. But still, he wrestles with himself, and walks the world restless. Then, Harry Potter stumbles back into his life, and he’s at a crossroads as well - struggling to convince himself that the life laid out for him is the one he truly wants. When Draco looks at him, he sees himself at sixteen. The same fear, the same despair. The same, iron-stiff conviction that he has no other choice. But now he knows: always, always, he has one.

The problem growing up with nothing is that once Harri was given something of her own, she wasn’t keen to share. An outreached arm offering a palm to shake as she introduces herself, a sharing of their names, a brush of fingers, a bright burn over her ribs, the feeling of becoming whole. Harri Potter meets the eyes of Tom Riddle and thinks Mine.

Omegas were a rarity nowadays. Plenty of alphas were still born, especially in the ranks of the pureblooded, but omegas were few and far between. Hermione hadn’t known what was wrong with her when she’d suddenly come over with a burning fever, an itchy throat and a raging libido in the middle of her and Harry’s tent that first time about three months ago. Harry had been equally clueless, pressing a cold compress to her forehead, blushing red and pushing her away as she begged him to fuck her to stop the pain. In the end, he’d warded her in the tent by herself, leaving her alone until she emerged a few days later, pale and ashamed and confused.        	It hadn’t taken the Death Eaters long to work out just what was wrong with her – or right with her, the way they saw it...

Somehow it gets brought up that they’re dating and A is instantly like “wait– we’re dating?”“Um, yeah???”“Oh cool weird”“What else would we have been? I’ve kissed you at least like 3 times every time I see you. We’ve gone to the movies every Saturday for two months.”“Honest, I was just kinda going with it.

Harry's summer holidays were Hell.First, him and Dudley were attacked by dementors. As a consequence of using magic to defende himself and his cousin, he gets expelled of Hogwarts. Then The Prophet publishes an article making Harry look like an attention seeker that used magic just because he felt like it and accusing him of being a liar because of what he said after the Triwizard Tournament about Voldemort.Second, his friends don't contact him not even let him know they are alive. Harry had to spend the entire holidays under the scrutiny of the Dursley and that means a lot of chores, very few meals and lots of time locked in his room.Tired of everything Harry decides that maybe if he writes a letter to the Quibller telling the true about what really happen with the use of magic in front of a muggle, hoping it may help him get his spot at Hogwarts back. It works. When people hear about the real reason that the Boy-Who-Lived they manifest and the ministry sees himself obliged to give Harry a trial as a way to make the entire situation right. Harry wins the trial by chance.What surprises him most is when he gets to Hogwarts and has to be sorted again.

Author’s note 11/7/2021: This work is complete!  Hermione thought her biggest issues this year would be  being stuck in a dead-end job and not quite getting along with her new officemate, Draco Malfoy. However, the Ministry is about turn her tidy and contained  life upside down with the announcement of the new Marriage and Family Law, and there's more trouble brewing as outbursts of uncontrolled magic begin to wreck havoc in the office. Draco has been reassigned to Corporate Services after an Auror mission went spectacularly sideways; at least, that's what he's telling everyone. The truth is hardly as straightforward and Granger has him increasingly on edge, so naturally, he was only too pleased to learn of the new Law that was going to out him as a Creature to the woman he loves.

He glanced at the dark corner of the lab, a type of breathing blackness that moved even when it didn’t, the very air and space and void of the darkness slowly expanding and contracting as the thing within it watched him. Theo flicked his wand, sending a key soaring toward the dark corner, clattering against the stone wall he could not see. Another flick, another careening key. Over and over and over again until one key going remained on the bench. “A point for going, today,” Theo mused.Without a care to the hour, and only modest curiosity about his destination, Theo picked up the key and activated it, hurtling himself somewhere, anywhere, but there.

Hermione Granger discovers world-shattering news about her own history. Immersed into yet another struggle, she sets aside her emotions and does what she has to do again. How will she cope with these changes? If that wasn't enough, discovering incredible new powers will allow Hermione the opportunity to continue her fight against evil with a surprising partner at her side. Will Hermione accept her fate or will she turn away from it and embrace the chance to rest? Has she been through too much to face another year full of unanticipated events?Laced with references to mythology (more as the work progresses) and dripping with emotion, this story was absorbing to write and hopefully to read! This is my first fanfiction so I hope you will forgive any mistakes. I am writing it as a sort of therapy. This is a post-war fic. The ages have been adjusted as I needed her to be a bit younger.

I, Lily Evans, do solemnly swear that I am up to no good.And wouldn’t Sev be proud! Not that I can tell her, since it would ruin the whole scheme. Really, its positively Slytherin of me.You see, I decided to give Sev a makeover for her sweet-sixteen and took her to Hogsmead to show her off. Guess who noticed?James Potter!I swear, the boy looked like he was going to cry. His whole face just screamed- “Wowza!” And “Boy, have I been a blind idiot!” Which is fair. Was I upset that James Potter was suddenly interested in my best friend? Merlin, no. It suited me just fine because, you see, I had set my eyes on Remus Lupin. That boy looks at me like a big bad wolf who could eat me up. Like, yes please. But the makeover wasn’t the scheme I mentioned earlier! No, that was just the beginning. You’ll have to keep reading if you want to know what I planned for my friend next. I’ll give you a hint…No, never mind, you’ll just have to read it.

Harry Potter is in his Sixth Year, he basically has insomnia, who wouldn’t? His friends are constantly smothering him, Dumbledore’s constantly asking him to his office and McGonagall’s badgering him about things she already knows he has. Snape’s fed up with constantly having to tell Harry that he’s not supposed to wander, and Harry’s got this…not altogether “healthy” interest in his Potions Professor.When one night Harry’s gets caught, Snape’s a little…Overzealous with his wayward student, the student constantly driving him mental, but turns out…Neither mind’s this all that much.

Harry continues to struggle with adapting to and understanding the wizarding world, which increasingly seems to have backed itself into a corner by allowing rampant anti-Muggle belief to coexist with rampant ignorance of the Muggle world.

Coming to the Wizarding World after a long and traumatic childhood, she slowly changes the tune to which the world dances. Snape notices first, then Quirrell, but how long will it take the rest of them to notice?  Will it be too late for the Light? How far is she willing to go to obtain power and how will she stay below the school's radar for as long as she plans?!!Abandoned, further plot outline included!!

Bellatrix Lestrange has no children in canon. (Let's reject the ""Delphini is the daughter of Bellatrix and Voldemort"" idea because it is non-sensical on many levels, starting with Bellatrix being passed middle age and having spent years of prison where she was probably underfed and lacked sunlight. In short, it would be very unlikely that she had the biological ability to produce children. Not to mansion the skirmish at Malfoy manor. On top of that, Voldemort doesn't seem like someone who would be interested in sex or fatherhood.)

Fred's room was the only one with a fireplace, so I was effectively going to be stuck in the same room with Fred and George for the next forty-eight hours. This wasn't even getting to the other terrible thing about this arrangement: Fred's room wasn't big enough for George and I to drag our mattresses in, so the three of us would also be sharing a bed for the next forty-eight hours.

Draco was lying still, and pale, on a bed in a private room in St Mungo’s. The sheets were white, clean, enchanted against stains, vanishing the blood that kept spilling out of him. He hadn’t moved in two days. Not a twitch of his elegant fingers. Not a blink of his fierce eyes. Harry couldn’t even see the faint flutter of his pulse in his throat from where he stood at the foot of the bed, helpless, impotent, furious.

Harem intrigue based on the Ming and Qing dynasties. Now with pictures at the end of some chapters. (Inspired by orphaned work Crimson Dream, but has since taken on a very different direction.)Son of Heaven and veritable demi-god, Emperor Voldemort has reigned for nearly 60 years. He's determined to reign for 10,000 more. While he has no Empress, his harem ever increases. Harry Potter is the son of a military official's concubine. He loves his mother, and only wants to live quietly with her and his pet owl. Imperial law requires he be considered for the inner palace, but with no power and no desire to impress he's confident he would never be selected.

Well, to be honest, if it were Finnigan he wouldn’t be this surprised, but this is Potter, Harry Potter, the boy who fucking lived we were talking about. He was the one who could get rid of the Dark Lord and ended the war for merlin's sake. Draco always thought Potter was brighter than this but nope, things have gone wrong because Potter is an absolute wanker.

 Remus Lupin didn’t have the slightest idea how he had survived the Battle of Hogwarts. All he knew, was that he woke up safe and sound underneath a black duvet and apparently – cared for. What he was most shocked to find out, however, was that the battle did not take the victorious turn he had hoped it to and that he was saved by the most unexpected person to do so.

When the Dursley's increasing hatred for Harry and his magic become too much for him, he spends as much time as he can at the library with the mysterious Maggie, a witch who insists that Harry is a wizard and that she can help him. Harry doesn't know what to believe, but Maggie lends him books and has really cool eyeliner so he's content with that. Maybe one day he'll even go to this Hogwarts place that she talks about. What will they think of him? Can Maggie really be trusted? What plans has Harry unwittingly caught himself up in? With all this to consider Harry may need to worry first about getting to Hogwarts alive.

Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff and Slytherin are working together, trying to clean up the castle and turn it back into a school--but honestly, no one should entrust their children to these idiots.
This is a fluffy, sitcom-like AU in which Gryf fights stuff, Rowena does things ""for science,"" Helga tries to keep her cookie stash under wraps, and Sal absolutely cannot talk to women. We learn why Ravenclaw's symbol is an eagle and why you really shouldn't piss off Helga Hufflepuff. At one point they set some acromantula on fire.

There is a sort insurmountable restlessness hanging in the air.
Mirage (noun): an image, produced by very hot air, of something illusory, without substance or reality; something that is caused by the bending or reflection of rays of light by a layer of heated air of varying density; a reflection of light that can trick the mind into interpreting the sight as an apparently solid thing.
It is close enough to be touched, tasted and marveled at until it is slipping through the fingers and flutters away like a delicate butterfly.

It's lovely up here; all meadows dotted with wildflowers, wind-beaten tracks criss-crossing this way and that through the fields, weaving inland to the pinewoods. The sun's hot on his back as he passes ramshackle stone walls, long since crumbled to piles of ancient rubble and scree, and then the path winds downwards, still following the line of the coast until Sirius finds himself outside an old white cottage, tucked away behind the hill with a rose garden that faces out to the sea. Sirius moves to Cornwall for the summer and meets a rude, beautiful boy who is writing a book that may or may not be about dragons.

Terrified of anyone like Voldemort coming to rise again, The Ministry of Magic implemented a set of strict new laws in an attempt to reform the Wizarding World. Once The Reform had taken hold, the once bright and thriving wizarding community became subject to something resembling a dictatorship. Harry’s Auror status is now a thing of the past as he makes attempts to take the law into his own hands unclouded by ministry ideals.
Forced to live out the rest of his days as a vampire as a result of an attack against Lucius, Draco finds a way to make the best of his situation. But after his lover died of mysterious circumstances, his world begins to crumble around him. It’s only when he is reacquainted with Harry that the truth about the state of the world becomes clear to him. Now Draco, out for blood, and Harry, inciting resistance, team up to take down the oppressors.

As colleagues for the F.A.U.C.E.T. (Fetching And Uncovering Creatures Experiencing Terror) department, Draco and Hermione have had their fair share of arguments. When they face their hardest case yet, mixed with an odd swarm of fireflies that glow in the colour according to how they feel about each other, Hermione is struggling to keep a straight mind.

""Malfoy, I’m just trying to do something at least! I don’t know how to keep them from taking our cases over, but if you reject all of my ideas, I can’t bloody help you either!”


The volume of her voice was rising, as well as the shrill tone she detested so much. She watched as Malfoy hurdled several pens across the room, accompanied by a bellow of angry, non-verbal noises.


“Not if your ideas suck so much! Get Potter in on this”, he continued with a mocking, nasal voice that imitated hers only seconds earlier, and Hermione’s ears rushed with a mount of blood, anger rising in her chest. The quill in her hand snapped.

Sirius has always felt almost undeserving of having kids his whole life. From the way his parents treated him to the way he felt he had not been able to take care of Harry. But maybe a little kid born in 2004 could change his mind.[From the fic: And with all the care in the world, he took the little bundle in his arms and looked at every part of his face and when his eyes opened and fluttered for a few seconds, Sirius just felt happiness flooding through his entire body. He could stay like that forever and would not bother]Inspired by the lyrics from the movie musical ""Mamma Mia! - Here We Go Again""

It's a good thing James has agreed to teach him the Patronus Charm this year. Though with all the whispers of Dementors and strange cultish activity, it seems many students have also decided to take things into their own hands and take a stand...

It felt more...intimate than showing it to Peter or James.

It's the Marauder's last year at Hogwarts, and everything around them is changing. With the Deatheaters gaining notoriety and blood purity relations on the fritz, the summer was tense. The summer saw muggleborn representation protests and wizards fighting for creature rights, but Hogwarts is the same as ever. Except, Remus grew about a foot and a half and into his body. Except, Sirius left his home forever, cut his hair to his shoulders, and spent the summer training. Except, James and Lily are friends now, and Marlene McKinnon seems very interested in Remus all of the sudden. Except nobody can forget the tense summer and the struggles they've been through. Sirius and Remus feel for each other more intensely than ever before, but can they cross that line? Will they risk their friendship for something more? Or will they skate around each other because they don't believe they're good enough for the other?

Pansy has been dragged to the party of a one-year-old she doesn't know, only to find the child's father drunk in his own kitchen. Seducing him seems to be her only way forward, and excellent revenge for being abandoned in favour of Hermione-sodding-Granger. --  “Would you stop being a fucking hero for one single second?” She slammed her mouth against his and she felt her lips scuff against his bottom lip in a way that, without the thick tension between them, could have been a truly awful first kiss. His lips slanted over hers and his fingers went back into her hair, tighter this time. He held her with her chin raised so that he could pull his bottom teeth along the edge of her cheek bone and into her hair where he took one long breath.

If there was one thing that almost everyone could say with certainty about Petunia Dursley, it was that she was smart. Not the traditional kind of intelligence involving math or science, but rather a more clever kind of smart. She was quick on the uptake and even quicker on the response. She always knew the thing to say to make people like her just as well as she knew the thing to say to make people fear her. Manipulation was her friend and lies were her minions. Every word that came out of her mouth was designed with clear intent and purpose. It was just unfortunate that for all her wisdom Petunia Dursley has no one to pass it on to. Now don’t get her wrong, she loved her darling son but even she knew a lost cause when she saw one. Her little Dudley just didn’t have the right kind of ruthless to him. He took too much after his father in that regard. No, she needed someone that knew hardship. Someone that saw what it took to survive and thrive. Someone that never broke despite all that opposed them. They needed to be the right sort of clever, the right sort of ruthless, the right sort of person. They needed to be like her.

Severus Snape, Seventeen year old Slytherin, had his life mapped out to the finest detail. He would finish his last year at Hogwarts, obtain a Potions Mastery, and from there, he was free. As an Alpha who had never gone into a rut before, the worries that typically troubled his classmates didn't seem to faze into the equation. He was thankful, really. The whole thing seemed entirely too bothersome. 
Then she came. 
Poppy Potter, sixteen and wayward, in a last ditch effort to win the war that had wrecked her world and seen many a good witch and wizard die, goes on one last mission into the past undercover as a Gaunt. She might be an Omega, something usually seen as small and sweet and soft, but that had never stopped her before. 
Then she was placed next to a young Severus Snape in Potions. 
Merlin help them both.

She had admired him from afar since she was fourteen. It had been a pubescent, school-girl crush back then. His strength and laughter had drawn her in. She glanced at him once again, indulging herself, before she went back to her book.He often found reasons to look at her. After all, how could he resist the sight of her curled up in a corner, lost in the book, sun shining in her wild mane of hair….. And sometimes, if he was really lucky, she would look out of the window wistfully, lost in thought and the sight would make his heart ache. No person should have the right to be so beautiful, he would think.

Sirius Black was many things; he was a good looking lad with lots of confidence that attracted so many girls in all Hogwarts he couldn’t even count; he was also quite smart and skilled in swinging his wand around, producing wonderful magic – speaking literally, of course, he sadly hasn't gone that far yet, even though he was an adult as of from a few weeks ago; he was also brave and careless, more often than not, helping out his best friend in his werewolf form every month. He was strong, and he was athletic. He was proud and loyal, and he was… Uh… Also a dog. Yes. A huge black dog. A magnificent huge black dog in his animagus form. So why, in the name of Merlin, being used to ghosts and magical creatures and monsters, did he shriek and jump like a little girl, almost pissing his pants when a petite figure crossed his way in the middle of the night?

Draco and Harry must learn how to navigate around the strict rules of the court and find a way to move away from their roles as pawns of kingdoms.

Continuation of Harry's birthday festivities. Draco makes pancakes, Harry prefers muggle whipped cream, and red is a terribly garish color that Harry thinks looks fantastic on Draco. 
This somehow turned into a roller coaster of fluff, angst and smut and I'd like to say that I planned it but this story kind of had a mind of its own.

Harriet Potter is finally free. The Girl-Who-Lived (and lived and lived and lived again) defeated Tom Marvolo Riddle at the Battle of Hogwarts after a lifelong fight witnessed by most of the world--but we all know that story. Now, her purpose, her reason for being, her life as the Chosen One--it no longer weighs heavy on her shoulders. Instead, she's haunted by loss. The grief, trauma, and scars inherited by the Wizarding World seem like too much. Leave it to Harry to believe it's all her fault.Of course, an annoyingly ever-present Draco Malfoy, true to form, shows up where he's least expected with a new purpose of his own. Intrigued by one another as, well, they always have been, Harriet and Draco tentatively try to leave the past in the past. Attempting to find a ""new normal"" proves impossible, as Harriet Potter hasn't lived a normal day in her entire life.

“You have ink on your cheek, love,” Tom murmured, crouching beside Hermione. He cast a wandless spell, the ink fading from her skin. Her eyes fluttered open, softening as she saw who was near her. “Tom,” she whispered, before closing her eyes again.""I'll take her to my room,"" Tom said, slowly gathering her into his arms. Her head rested against his shoulder, her dark curls cascading down her back. Draco moved to his feet and unbuckled the Mary Jane's from her feet.Hermione often spent her nights divided between the two; only sleeping in her own, private room when ill. Though when she’d come down with a nasty case of the cat flu, Draco had curled beside her, and read silly, muggle-born romances to her, that she would never admit to liking, while Tom brewed potions for her using Slughorn's lab. She was their witch, the only one that Tom or Draco would ever share.Maybe, she was always meant to be theirs.Canon AU | The Golden Trio never existed, in its stead are three, pining Slytherins.

Lily Evans and James Potter were never Harry's true parents. Lily is his mother, but James only pretends to be his father to protect Lily's reputation, but later ends up doing it to protect them all. Severus Snape isn't the bad guy here; he's the one who saw through Albus Dumbledore's lies and made sure to get himself away from the old coot so he could live. Voldemort never condoned the killing of children or women, but deemed it necessary to do so whenever they opposed him and wouldn't do as they were told when in battle.Lucius Malfoy is an Aristocrat through and through; especially when it comes to getting the Dark Lord what he wants, which is a changed name for a certain raven-haired boy, who becomes Harlan Severus Prince; the Dark Lord's most powerful Nox.

I'm not 100% sure what it is, but there was a challenge at some point in the last 20 years where you shuffle your playlist, and the top 25 songs you write something only as long as the song. So I thought I'd try that! Is that even a thing? Well, if it isn't, it is now!

Betrayal of the magical world all started with the manipulations of Albus Dumbledore. The muggles have taken a stand against the whole of magic. They snapped wizards and witch’s wands. They trapped them in their contraptions. It was nothing but a sick war game to them.  Magical creatures hunted down and eradicated. Magic faded from the world, leaving it uninhabitable. Only one soul can stop the extinction of magic: The boy marked by dark, and manipulated by light. Only he can save the world from the plague known as muggles.

AU Severus Snape survived the war. Harry decided against being an Auror.A few years down the line, Snape married Harry in order to help counter a deadly blood curse, probably placed on him while he was still working under cover as a Death Eater. They may not get on brilliantly still, but Harry is willing to remain his spouse for as long as it takes, and also to help cement Severus's rocky reputation as a hero.Just as Harry has accepted that Severus will always dislike him, a new development in their relationship challenges that.

“You alright?” he yelled.

As the line between the Muggle world and Wizarding world is getting thinner and thinner in the modern era, the Ministry of Magic around the world is forced to make new regulations and an entirely new section to accommodate the new change in both worlds. They create “Muggle Agents” underneath the Auror section.Newt, being a Squib, took the offer to be one of them to pay off his animal (and magical creatures) shelter plus small vet clinic and his tuition in veterinary and zoology while also wanting to be an independent person in both worlds. Newt ignored the fact that Theseus was so happy to have him working in the Ministry like him and he could protect him anytime.Little did he know, he had caught the attention of a powerful dark lord.Rated M for implied sex scenes and perhaps possible triggers in the future, but mostly is still rated T/T+(tags and rating may change and/or add in the future)

The funeral was small. Close friends and family only. With the war going on, it was dangerous to have too many people attend in such a small setting— “an easy target” as Moody reminded everyone diligently. Remus sat with his hands folded in his lap next to Sirius, who was sitting very still and staring at the floor with a numb expression on his face. He had already broken down earlier that morning in their flat as the two of them were getting ready, and Remus had held him for several long moments trying to keep him together. Now, Sirius seemed determined not to show any emotion. It was for James’ sake, Remus was sure. Sirius wanted to be strong for his brother as they buried Euphemia and Fleamont. As they buried their parents.

Lydia may be a year older, but she isn’t any less confused. Not only does she somehow have friends - six of them! - Lydia also makes even more in her second year at Hogwarts. Not to mention how   much she learned! It’s a really useful spell, bombarda. Not nearly as useful as solitaire, according to Madam Pomfrey (Lydia spends way too much time in the hospital wing).Hogwarts isn’t all fun though. She’s about to learn what it feels like to look death in the face and come out of it as stone. Well, close to stone anyway; Lydia's very thankful for those mandrakes! She doesn’t fancy being a statue her entire life. Lydia will realize her motto of staying under the radar is much harder to stick to when you’re a Muggleborn in a castle with a fifty year old murderous maniac that wants you dead. And adults say being a kid is easy!

Post-War, Harry and Draco are in their 30's and happily married, with a twelve-year-old daughter, Rosie Luna Malfoy-Potter - named after Draco's grandmother's maiden name and Remus Lupin (Moony). She is in her second year of Hogwarts and is showing amazing progress in all her classes, but potions especially. Draco claims she's taking after him - Draco is a world-famous healer, he travels the world, teaching and aiding in hospitals. He's currently in France, teaching a week of lectures at Beauxbatons school. Harry disagrees, claims that when she begins her DADA lessons, she'll be top of the class - Harry is Hogwarts' DADA professor. Rosie was a gorgeous girl, very very small, with the prettiest white hair and these gorgeous green eyes. She has Potter's terrible eyesight, too. Something she got from Draco's bloodline, however, was much more consequential. She has a blood curse. It had always been dormant, right up until she was eight. Draco was the only healer in Europe able to relieve her of the pain. It hadn't been active since. Not until last week, just as Draco left for France and they returned to Hogwarts after Christmas break, Rosie has fallen unwell.

Tom re-read the letter twice more to make sure he was not hallucinating before refolding it and returning it to it’s envelope. Strangely, the first emotion he felt was not fury, at the absolute audacity of the woman, but rather, he felt hollow.

He did not feel sadness, anger, joy or even confusion.It’s 1943, Grindelwald’s war rages on, and Tom Riddle discovers there is more to the Riddle family than he originally anticipated.

But through treachery of snakes, the covenant was broken and the rightful heirs of Aleshut were forced into transliminal hiding, ruling over a hidden empire until the day of the true return. And in those days the empire of the Cyrodiils was dead, save in memory only. Yet the memory now returns...

It was apparent that a little boy had survived the killing curse cast by the infamous 'Dark Lord', but what many lacked knowledge of was that a second child survived that night too. Of course, why would they ever need to know that?
Her family name had been tarnished, smeared into nothing but a blur of lies; with one father being accused of working for You-Know-Who—the other supposedly fleeting into the night, heartbroken that his lover could ever do such a thing. To betray Lily and James Potter.
But in order for both to be kept safe—from infamy and from a ruined family reputation—sacrifices would need to be made. That's why both had to be raised like twins, left on the Dursley's doorstep with a note affixed to their shared basket, explaining who they were, their legacies, and most importantly; that they were to be raised as siblings to protect their very lives.
But (Name) Andromeda 'Potter' wouldn't believe a word of it. She refused to believe that her parents were dead, or that she and Harry were really siblings. She loved him like a brother, but a feeling deep in her gut told her otherwise.

Draco looks down into his cup, then back up into the smirking face of Ronald Weasley. “Weaselby,” he grinds out quietly, mindful of the children giggling raucously nearby as they slurp on their own cones. “I realize that the art of understanding spoken language may be beyond your capabilities, but this is not what I ordered.”“On the contrary! I believe this is exactly what you want.” Weasley reaches over the counter and jabs a finger at the cup as he begins to list: “Extra dark chocolate mocha reminiscent of the shaggy hair you dream about, with a gentle kick of cayenne because I know you want some spice in your life. Topped with my new range of lightning sprinkles! They buzz when they touch your tongue!” Weasley winks with this last statement, as if he’s said something relatable, or amusing, or literally anything besides infuriatingly annoying, which he is.

England, 1814. At twenty years old, Harry Weasley is a clever, if somewhat sheltered Omega who has hardly ever left the small town of Hogsmeade, where he grew up. He would not say that he is lonely, just that the days are too long. Now that most of his siblings have moved on, Harry occupies his time the best he can while dreaming of London high society. Nothing much interests him apart from his books and the letters he receives from his brothers, so when the news arrives that the Longbottom heir has returned to take ownership of his father’s estate, Harry doesn’t make much of it. After all, it couldn’t possibly affect him. Nor could the arrival of a certain Mr Snape, the rude and arrogant Alpha who deems Harry “barely tolerable.” No, none of that could possibly affect Harry’s life, could it?Why yes, this is the Pride and Prejudice inspired a/b/o snarry fic you’ve all been secretly craving!

Dumbledore seemed to know, down to the hour, of what had to happen to get Harry to go to his death. How did he manage this? Certainly he had various pawns who knowingly or unwittingly helped him towards his goal of furthering the Greater Good. Yet his greatest achievement was the witch who stood by Harry throughout it all. This is Hermione's story. The hidden 'rest of the story' where she worked to save Britain from Voldemort by ensuring that Harry became the martyr he needed to be. This is NOT a Evil Hermione story.

This wasn't the life she'd expected to have after the War; tracking fugitive Death Eaters hell-bent on revenge, avoiding her fame and running from an overbearing ex-boyfriend and his mother, insistent that they marry. But when Hermione temporarily settles on a quiet patch of territory in the States and meets a handsome young man, her life changes for the better as he gives her a new outlook on life and a new love. The kind of love she had craved and that she needed. Rated for language, violence and sexual content. This does have Ron/ Molly Weasley bashing, and Cullen bashing! (Mostly Edward and Bella).

Harry wasn’t stupid, he was almost sorted into Slytherin for Merlin’s sake. He knows that Tom Riddle’s interested, even if the poor guy didn’t seem to know it himself. The bloody idiot’s almost revealed his own feelings, like about twelve times, but then again Harry wasn’t sorted into Slytherin for a reason. He was kind, and he couldn’t help but feel a little bad for the emotionally constipated Slytherin Prefect. So, he decided to help out by trying to make Riddle realize that no, he would be a terrible candidate for the top student’s love interest.It started on the Quidditch Pitch, and of course it bloody well did. Alternatively, Harry's first sabotaging of Tom’s attempts at asking him out, much to Tom’s future confusion and frustration.(This is the first part of a twelve-part series.)Chinese Translation by Otteon available here.

Three years after the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry Potter is starting his second year at the Darthorn College for Advanced Magical Craft. Ron and Harry have managed to get into the famously rigorous Auror training (AT) programme, and though times have been hard for him after the war, Harry is ecstatic to be back. Not even finding out that he has class with Draco Malfoy for a whole term could meddle with his drive now. Or could it? What has that guy been up to lately, anyway? Not that Harry cares, of course, but... does he?This work is my Drarry canon - it explores in depth the character arch that Draco truly deserved. Harry, whose traumatic upbringing often goes ignored, also receives a more humane treatment from an author point of view. A sequel is in the planning stages.

Time had never really cooperated with Draco Malfoy. Before the war, he had wanted it to speed up; during the Dark Lord’s reign, he wanted it all to stop and give him time to think, to plan. And now, now that it was all over, he wants everything to just slow down so he can finally be given a chance to catch his breath and move on, become something other than a war criminal. He wants all that remains, including himself, buried six feet under and little more than a memory, but the only saint he knows seems determined to change his mind. He had heard that there was no rest for the wicked, even in death - turns out it’s especially true for those with the Malfoy name.

“Are you implying that I am responsible for Voldemort’s actions?” Dumbledore’s voice had finally turned cold.“No, I’m saying you’re responsible for neglecting a young boy! You treated him with nothing but suspicion and coldness, and when he grew up suspicious and cold you took that as confirmation that you were always right about him.”“I assume you have a reason for laying these heavy charges at my feet,” said Dumbledore quietly.She sighed. “I just think… maybe you should take your own advice and try to solve this problem with love, not destruction. You don’t have to destroy a Horcrux. You can heal it.”“You speak of remorse,” Dumbledore didn’t sound impressed. “If I may, I see very little chance of convincing Voldemort to feel empathy for the things he has done –”“Not Voldemort,” she interrupted. “Tom.”“You are suggesting that we use Voldemort’s first Horcrux to reanimate sixteen-year-old Tom Riddle.” Dumbledore's tone left much to be desired.

All the while the growing power of Lord Voldemort looms in the distance. Very Canon story.

What if there was no Voldemort? What if Dumbledore had prepared Harry for something that never came to pass? No Chambers or Horcruxes or Dead Godfathers? How would the cast of Hogwarts Castle deal with a new kind of enemy? A new kind of fight?Harry & Hermione are activists for Muggle Rights and start an organization at Hogwarts in opposition to the new Magic Born club which is headed by Draco Malfoy. Percy Weasley is also fighting for Muggle Rights at the Ministry and he helps out with their club when he can. Snape is a drunk. Remus is OK. McGonagall is status quo happy. Ron Weasley is a bigot.

This is a collection of random drabbles, mostly involving Hermione and the older Weasley boys. Almost all were originally written to amuse myself and others in FB groups, and I've posted them for those who enjoy tiny scenes. To save you asking, I have no plans to expand any of these (though I did also say that about the one-shot which is now a 400k+ word saga, so I'm clearly not to be trusted on that... 😆)Hope you enjoy. I'm a real-life author who does this for fun. I have zero interest in critical input, so save it for those who will use it, but happy comments are always welcome.

Draco hadn’t spared her a second thought until the end of his first year.***It's funny how hate can stem from envy.It's interesting how envy implies admiration.It's Hogwarts from Draco's perspective!.....If Draco secretly harbored feelings for Hermione Granger and definitely wasn't aware of those feelings.

Seated on a low chair at his father’s left hand, Sirius watched as Orion’s dark mood deepened. His father was angry, he could see the agitation, displeasure, disdain written across his once handsome face. There was naught new in this, his father had long preferred his younger brother, Regulus. Regulus, the dutiful son, who had always bent to his father’s will. Regulus, whose seat at Orion’s right hand now lay empty.

After meeting Dumbledore at a party with Slughorn, he employs you as a teacher at Hogwarts for the new subject of theatre/literature of the Wizard World. One of the first tasks to do is to form a theatre group and organise a performance at the end of the school year. Yet, this subject is rare at Wizard schools and you are met with quiet a lot of suspicion from your students and colleagues. This causes more than one sleepless night and after Dumbledore can’t take your exhausted face every morning at the teacher’s meeting, he sends you to Severus Snape to get a potion that’ll help you sleep. Reluctantly you go to the teacher you’ve been most afraid of but with every visit your feelings for him change for the better. The menacing potion master seems to feel the same..

If either of them cared to be honest about this, they'd probably see how much of a long time coming them finding each other this way is.

Draco smiled to himself just thinking the word, Fate. It was such a very Potter word, Harry would be so proud - too proud, better not tell him. Yet, it felt like it, now that they were there, never counting anything but the number of potatoes they'd need to feed all the people, young and not so much, that meant family to them.


And Draco only ever went through mild phases of existential crisis when his unsuspected inner Molly Weasley became too prominent for his liking anymore. Only mild. He didn't screech in panic about it anymore - Harry's words.

Part two of my, probably, massive mess of a story.Harry Potter is finally going to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  He is about to get a crash course in expectation vs reality.  With his newly made friend, Draco Malfoy, and his irritable tutor, Severus Snape taking up a position of the Potions Professor, it is bound to be interesting.  Meanwhile, the Jones family is bringing technology to the wizarding world and meddling in things they should probably leave alone.  Not that that had ever stopped them before.

PWP that takes place during Pacify Part 2, Chapter 4: ""What He Wants""Inspiring passage from Part 2, Chapter 4: “Good. Get on your knees.”Harry hadn’t gotten on his knees. Instead, he’d said, “Make me.”That was one of his favorite things to say: make me. So, Severus made him. He used his belt, gave him ten hard lashes, and made him count. Then, he yanked him to the ground against the edge of the bed and fucked his mouth. Harry didn’t tell him to stop, didn’t show sparks, didn’t beg for mercy. He just took it, and took it, and got himself off, and afterwards he said thank you, and snuggled up to Severus in bed until he stopped trembling.He never said no. Never.

The idea of Pureblood Courting methods is not my own, I took inspiration from Ellory’s series  “Pureblood Wizarding Culture”. It’s a great series and even though I don't ship all of the pairings it was great writing. All the characters belong to J. K. Rowling and I only genderbent Regulus. Disclaimer: There is no Voldemort in this AU because he was a half-blood and no one would have followed him, and even if he was accepted into Hogwarts, he would have really diluted magic and he wouldn't be powerful enough to gain followers. Also Remus isn't a werewolf because he doesn't deserve to be hurt like that.

""Sirius closes his eyes, overcome and humbled by an acute rush of desire. The association of watching Remus and wanting something more evokes the memory of Remus’s body after the full moon, shipwrecked on the mangled four-poster bed hidden in the depths of the Shrieking Shack. Artfully draped and marred in bruises like some kind of battered mythical hero, Remus’s naked body was the twin image of a muggle painting that Sirius had encountered on a trip to the Tate museum in London at the tail end of the summer before their seventh year.""———With barely three weeks left before his final departure from Hogwarts, Sirius is confused about a lot of things — namely, the status of his friendship with Remus. If this results in brusque attempts to persuade Remus to move into his London flat or tactlessly explore the question of Remus’s sexuality, then so be it.Or the one where Sirius is oblivious about his feelings until he isn’t.

Remus had learnt as a child that the world was a cruel place and that the best he could hope for was to survive and keep going, month by month, no matter how hard it may be.

A small foot tapped the side of his palm, and lightly jostled the remains of the ring. Harry slowly turned horrified eyes to the baby still in his arms. His eyesight blurred as the full horror of what he’d done dawned on him.“She didn’t mean to,” Mrs. Weasley said with another quiver in her voice. Harry barely heard her explanation of how sometimes a witch’s power lashed out during a particularly painful and problematic delivery. Mrs. Weasley went on to say Ginny would have never intentionally destroyed the ring, but Harry wasn’t mad. He didn’t blame Ginny for destroying his horcrux. She hadn’t; not really. Harry recalled the sense of rightness he’d felt when he was first given the child. Ginny didn’t destroy his horcrux, because the baby was its new vessel.  --Or that time Harry made a just-in-case horcrux, gave it to Ginny, brown chicken brown cow, died, came back, woke up from a coma, and was given a baby and a broken horcurx. Harry is left wondering if he's raising his own horcrux.Note: The story starts with Harry/Ginny, but she dies. End game is Harry/Draco.

Join our heroes in an unlikely past where Harry and Taytum grew up as brother and sister. But they were not alone. They had another member of the family, Alice Black. Together their lives were better for it. But everything changes when in the timeline we knew (from our previous stories in this series) the death eaters find one of the last remaining time turners. They have fractured time. Alice, Taytum, and Harry journey into the alternate timeline and find the lives they always wish they had. Forced to play different roles in this new world the three of them battle the false memories and their own memories of their original lives. When time is shattered completely our heroes are forced to make a decision that might put an end to everything they knew. Their time in this timeline comes at a cost, the longer that time is shattered the more likely the timelines are all to come crashing together to form one timeline and eliminating time travel forever.

Soulmark AU. The first Wizarding War didn’t happen as we were told. Hogwarts had shut down at one point where Voldemort was at his worst. The Order stepped in and silenced him, saving a few of their own in the process. Everything is normal.
The Order has been keeping touch for a while, using aliases on notes, although no one knows who the person behind said notes is.
Only a mere 4 years have passed, and now they are all needed again. Another war is on the horizon, revolving around the Order, Voldemort and a select few of their newest “recruits”, who may or may not be children still.
As the Order faces this threat, they face their soulmates, as well.
Excerpt Ch1:“When the five-year-old smiled, green eyes bright, Remus understood the need to not run away again - never for something so important - which made him wonder where Padfoot had traveled off to.In his letters and in the War, Padfoot had been the constant for Remus and a decent amount of others in the Order, yet he vanished and didn’t even take the time for a simple reply as of late.”

“You’re not Harry Potter,” Malfoy told him, pronouncing it like a title, like a proper noun that was not a person’s name. “Just as I’m not Draco Malfoy.” He licked his lips, feeling how thin and fragile the space between them had just become. He spread his fingers along the edge of the table, knowing that in another world, one where he’d learned tenderness and courage, he would slide one hand across and clasp it over Harry’s now. He didn't. He just said, “I used to be. You may never have been.”

 
Harry is given what should have been a boring routine bureaucratic assignment. If it hadn't taken him to Maine. If it hadn't forced a reunion with Draco Malfoy.
Now nothing seems boring or routine anymore.

There was something Fred wanted him to remember ... something that called to him ...   (AN: I have had a slew of requests for me to continue my George/Ginny fanfiction, and it also holds a close space in my heart due to it being the first bit of fiction I ever wrote on archive, and so this is going to be a place for my snippets and whatever I want to pull out of their story and elaborate on. There may be a bunch of different elaborated tales, or just a few, but over time I will probably be updating this and adding to it. Some of the snippets/parts may feed into each other, while others won't. I will vary in points of view between George and Ginny, because in my original fic you only see Ginny's perspective, so it will be fun to show you George's from time to time.  But know, this is all a cannon companion to its parent fic. (A Tale of Scarlet: Forbidden Moments) and I would advise you to read that first, before reading this, so you get what is happening and why. But, without further ado! I hope you enjoy this work!)

The door cracked open behind Harry.""Come, Mr Potter, it would appear that we have outstayed our welcome tonight.""Harry thought that Severus looked a lot better, he had stopped his shaking and his eyes were focused right again. He ignored the drops of crimson, slowly seeping through the strange robe's sleeve, falling to the stone below, wondering if maybe Vernon though Severus was a Freak too.Now- Harry vaguely noted- the lady on Number 8 was moving. Running, in fact, towards him.""Yes, sir."" Harry whispered, eyes wide and so bright in the shallow moonlight.He didn't think that Severus heard it over the wail of nearing sirens, but he took Harry's hand none the less.~~~Severus was not made to be a father, he did not want to be made a father. And yet, somehow, he ended up with something of a child. A strange child that soaks up his knowledge like a sponge, a strange child with an uncanny ability to read him, a strange child that acts as a beacon for all those who wish to kill him. ~~~

Hermione has enjoyed a ‘special’ relationship with Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. Unbeknownst to her, so has Severus. And while they have both enjoyed the Malfoys immensely, they yearn for something more.Based (sort of) on raywyn2k’s prompt: Hermione finds Severus and Lucius drinking together, and is invited to join them. That’s not ordinary Firewhiskey—it’s Severus’ special blend that reduces inhibitions. And then it’s time for the “Two Truths and a Lie” game. (Or Fuck, Marry, Kill)I admit I went a bit off piste, but I hope I did fulfil the remit for Romance. HEA. PWP. D/s (Male Dom. And sorry about Lucius running off halfway through the story.

Special thanks to my beta, J, who is not only the best in the business, but gave me the encouragement I needed to write. I would not be here but for J. There are some additional notes at the end, which may shed a little light on some of the more esoteric parts of the story.

This is just a series of drabbles I've written over the years for LiveJournal's various drabble groups. For those who are wondering, a Drabble is a story written (usually) in 100 words exactly. You can write more, but the paragraph/idea/moment must be 100 words. Most of these are from the GrangerSnape100 Challenge, but I've thrown a few others in as well. Drabbles are an excellent writing exercise, and I encourage any writer to give them a try. It's never easy telling a story in 100-word bites, but it's my belief I wrote some of my best work in drabbles.

The blanket fort they set up last night is still standing. It’s elaborate, a skill Draco learned once Harry started bringing him around to family gatherings. There are tunnels and hidden nooks and fairy lights strung up inside. It’s not as elaborate as the kind of magic used to expand tents, but the space is larger than it should be. The center of the fort is a cozy nest of pillows and blankets big enough for the four of them, and that’s where Harry wants to be. He crawls inside, and Draco follows, his eyebrows drawn together in curiosity.
Harry flops down onto his back once he reaches the center, squirming until he’s found a good position. Draco perches next to him, bringing one knee up to his chest and wrapping his arms around it. He isn’t uncomfortable, just waiting patiently until he knows what Harry is aiming for.
“Rest with me,” Harry says, rubbing one of Draco’s arms.

Seven years into Hermione Granger’s tenure as Headmistress of Hogwarts, the castle will reveal a secret that changes everything she ever knew about it, the role of Head of Hogwarts, and herself. Written for LiveJournal’s Summer 2014 SSHG_Promptfest.
I would like to thank my amazing beta stgulik for brainstorming, editing, and encouraging me through those dark and lonely nights when I had to roam through this castle alone, with not even a ghost for company. Any mistakes you see here are mine, because I couldn’t help but go back and hide some Easter eggs for her to find. This was originally posted in answer to Tophoenix’s prompt in the 2014 SSHG_Promptfest on LiveJournal, but I have made some small changes and corrections here.

""The Magical Love Story of Albus Potter & Scorpius Malfoy"" or ""Harry Potter Turned Upside-Down""  An unusual love story turned sideways and inside-out.Although this is a mature story - there's nothing too obscene to worry about I'd say the story works well with teens and up. PG Rating (Maybe)

“It’s like playing a game,” Harry said. “A judging game. You sit and listen and at the end of the day you’ll decide whether Severus Snape deserves to die or not.” His father had spent his whole life trying to protect Harry from the outside world, from himself, at the expense of his own life. Now it was Harry's turn to at least try. *Fic Submission for the first annual Tri-Writing Tournament. (Round Three)

Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood, having become lovers during their time in the DA at Hogwarts, pursue a most unconventional relationship after the War. Neville splits time between his grandmother's estate and a spartan London flat, working the swing shift at the DMLE as an Auror. Luna spends most of her time traveling the world, gathering information on the rarest of Magical Beasts, and Where to Find Them.This work is a continuation of the Neville/Luna relationship established in chapters of the related works tagged below, but should be easy to follow for those who have not (yet) read those stories.We begin as an unexpected development, resulting from their last meeting, knocks Neville for a loop...

I’m always delighted when my Muse gives me something like this, especially on Halloween. It’s so out of the realm of his remit that I know he is indulging some very dark side of me. This is NOT a story for the faint of heart. It is a deep, dark, awful tale dredged from the bottom of my black soul. It all began with a question, or rather, a series of questions that came to me while perusing Wal-mart, as scary a place as anyone would ever want to go:
What happens when a Dementor kisses a wizard who has split his soul with murder? Does the Dementor become his Horcrux? Is the Dementor drained by it? And scarily of all – does the wizard become a kind of Dementor himself?
I suppose I will never know, and neither will Hermione Granger. Happy Halloween, my friends.
Warning: Every one in the book. Creepy!Evil!Severus, Suicidal!Hermione, Major character death, dub-con, necrophilia (if you squint), murder, mayhem, lions and tigers and bears, oh my…
A/N: I do not own these characters and after this fic, I’m sure they are profoundly grateful for that fact.

After the Battle of Hogwarts, Harry and Draco both fall into their own battles with their mental states. Draco is sent to Azkaban, and Harry turns to drinking, hoping to forget. 
Months later, Harry visits St Mungo’s new ward on the request of a friend, only to find Draco in a deep vegetative state. 
Not willing to give him up, Harry stays by his side, while simultaneously dealing with the Ministry's newest grand idea to make everything worse.
Making new allies, and losing old ones along the way, will hopefully be worth it in the end.

Remus stood in shock for a moment not realizing what had happened exactly. He looked back into the closet which did indeed hold a medium sized crate. It was incredulously over glamorized, gilded silver with ornate little swirls all over it. It looked to have seen better days, a bit rusted at the hinges but otherwise normal, a padlock hung loosely from the door latch. When Remus took a closer look though he noticed a piece of chalk inside, and small drawings on the wall in-between the bars of the cage.

“I could give you everything, you know,” she didn’t turn her head at his familiar refrain, instead watching as the moon rose, its rays drifting through the lace curtains. “You would only have to say yes.”“Tom,” Hermione said, her exasperated tone one he knew all too well. ""Hermione,"" Tom mocked, his hand resting on the small of her back. He felt every vertebra of her spine, his fingers lightly tracing them. She was so small in comparison to himself, ore like the little bird that he'd once called her than he cared for her to be. ""Or is it 'Mione now?""He was careful, ever so careful, as he felt her stiffen against him. He didn’t let go, instead, shifting to hold her closer. He knew that she needed him there, the warmth of his body seeping into hers. His arms slipped around her naked waist and pulled her back flush against his chest. No, he thought. He would never let her go again, no matter what she said. He had already lost his wife, his mate once, and wouldn’t do so again. “Never to you.""Tomione Smut Fest 2020 | Affair

“Alright. Okay,” Harry begins unsteadily, “Why is he here?” For a moment the three of them, Ron-Hermione-Malfoy. All seem to have a mental conversation on who should take this question. After a brief silence, Draco sighs wearily, “For fucks sake. I’ll tell him. We’re married.” Now it’s Harry’s turn to be dumbfounded. This is a good joke. It is. He waits for George Weasley to burst into the room and yell ‘Surprise!’. He waits for Ron to snort and say ‘Did you see your face?’ But nothing happens. Nobody’s laughing.  ***After a raid gone awry, Harry loses the last seven years of his memory.

The day Voldemort won the war, darkness fell over the country. Twenty-three years passed beneath a sky filled with gray clouds, the sound of thunder in the distance and the scent of rain a constant in the air. While the resistance still fought against the Deatheaters, the battles were bloody and tiring.James and Albus Potter shouldn’t exist in this world. The last of their bloodline and raised in isolation due to the bounty on their name, they never attended Hogwarts like their parents. Maybe worse, they’d never seen a sky that wasn’t at the brink of pouring rain. Their lives are governed by strict rules set in place for their protection, but Potter’s have never been known for their obedience in doing what they're told. As reckless and chaotic as their predecessors, the brothers fight behind everyone’s backs, including each others.After years of living in darkness, meetings of happenstance open new doors. The isolated meet the abused, and though they are enemies, they are inexplicably drawn to one another. Maybe it's fate. Maybe in another timeline they would have been friends. Maybe the love that grows between them is strong enough to end the eternal darkness and bring back blue skies.

For Freya Sallow, it seemed like she had the worst luck in the world. She was born into a high achieving pureblood family, with sky-high expectations of her from the moment she opened her eyes. Her mother died when she was young, leaving her to be raised by her neat-freak professor father.Freya's always been the one to be overlooked - to be forgotten. When she starts Hogwarts, that changes. For the first time in her life, she has real friends. Sure, half her classmates hate her because they think the professors are playing favourites, but it could be worse. And then, in classic Freya fashion, it gets worse. In addition to navigating Hogwarts and the Wizarding World while a dark wizard is steadily gaining power, she has to deal with her impending fate. For generations, a curse has been passed from mother to daughter that will eventually leave them trapped in the body of a falcon. There's no cure, not yet at least. But despite the help of some of the most talented living wizards, time is not on her side. Updates every Saturday.  Rated Teen and Up for Mild Language Use.Also posted on Wattpad.

“What were you looking for, Muddy?” she questions instead, voice breezy and light—though there’s a certain steel underlying every word, an unspoken warning that tells Hermione she’d do well not to lie here. Hermione swallows, keeping her gaze fixed steadfastly upon the marble flooring beneath her as she answers, “Painkillers, Mistress.”Bellatrix frowns at that (though Hermione can’t see it), then draws closer to her pet, bridging the space between them in a matter of moments. “‘Painkillers’?” she repeats in a skeptical tone, placing a single slender finger beneath Hermione’s chin and forcing her gaze upwards to meet her own. “Y-Yes, Miss,” Hermione stammers, doing her very best not to lose focus as she looks obediently back into darkened eyes (her Mistress’ irises such a deep shade of brown they’re very near black), subversive arousal flaring low in her gut at her current predicament.

And then he went and fell in love and discovered the desperate uncertainty of it.***This work is the prequel to Debts of Honor, it is entirely Viktor POV, it takes place from August to June of his year studying abroad, and this means it is unresolved angst.

The theory of space, time, and pocket dimensions.  Where the edge's of all three distortions collide it ends with an outsider being dropped off among the outre. Now normally it's a balancing act, because guests were always welcomed, if not immediately thrust into positions of authority because that's what they'd done before with their last ""visitor"".  The results were mixed but life had moved on and Nook'd left that town in the making as quietly and quickly as he could after..This one is too young to be talked into anything much less take on a mayor's duties like they'd done with that last.  And the being's injuries are enough that Nook isn't going to even suggest the idea.  So he takes a different route and finds himself a sudden father of three.If a certain letter finds it way to Nook Inc's headquarters, AKA Tom Nook's house, he's already got a letter of denial set, a ""denial"" stamp just with a glossy black ink awaiting the press of rubber, and more than enough time and anger to think up the proper punishment for any responsible for this mess from the boy's side of the distortion.A free one way trip to Tarantula Island courtesy of Nook INC leapt to mind.

The table got quiet when they realized Harry was still standing and was intending on continuing.Harry stared at Charlie. Charlie stared back. Harry couldn’t read the expression on Charlie’s face, so he decided to channel his Gryffindor spirit and continue.“And raise a glass to losing your virginity!”. The room immediately silenced.

Draco twisted it between his fingers... back and forth. The metal wasn’t particularly unique in appearance, it was actually rather plain. Yet, the piece had been discovered in the corpse of Hogwarts. Amongst the ruins of his former house, in the dungeons. It bore his family crest. Curious. No jewels adorning it, one of the many faceless minions brought it to him hoping for favor. Everyone recognized the Malfoy crest, feared it. He glanced briefly at the crumpled mass bleeding out on his floor, smirking. Favor indeed. He would need to refer to his father, ask what he knew. How had it been buried there? Who’s had it been? He sensed power pulsing. Curious. His mind wandered back to the blood and smoke of that final battle, the day the Dark Lord rose and conquered... the day hope died. The day many good men, women, and child soldiers fell... that Harry Potter was frozen within Amber... when Granger vanished. Most believed she was dead, but years later, Draco somehow knew she was alive and kicking somewhere. He’d keep orders current for her capture, to be brought directly to him. She’d be alone now... he almost pitied the survivors. His own guilt ate at him enough. The silver almost felt warm.

 For Hermione Granger, agreeing to work in the Mental Rehabilitation Center is the latest attempt at stitching her life back together. For Draco Malfoy, finishing his court-mandated rehab has just gotten a lot harder. Soon, Hermione and Draco find themselves in the middle of a storm of new politics, power struggles, and pureblood culture. But a growing connection between them might not only change the course of their lives, but also the future of the Wizarding World.

“How have you been?” repeats Harry as the two begin their walk toward the entrance to the platform, Teddy preoccupied with a toy Harry had conjured for him. George doesn’t really know how to respond. He could say ""Oh, I’ve been doing my best, but now I’m coming undone at the thought of you"" or ""I hope you feel the same"" or ""I think I’ve fancied you since I was fifteen"" or ""Please touch me again, in that way you did on your birthday."" He settles for “okay” and he hopes Harry understands everything that okay holds.--George Weasley is so alone and Harry Potter is so beautiful.

At the end of his life, Harry is given the chance to alter the course of the dark reality his son Albus and Albus' friend Scorpius create when they use a Time-Turner to save Cedric Diggory's life. With the hindsight bestowed by a lifetime as Auror, Head of the DMLE, husband, father, and friend, he will make very different choices as a seventeen-year-old wizard to try and save the people and the world he loves.But if he has to do it all over again, simply defeating Voldemort won't be good enough: there's a never-ending scroll of tragedies to avert and one newly-installed Headmaster of Hogwarts to talk around (if he manages to get a word in edgewise before getting hexed). The good news is, as always: he's not fighting alone.**This story contains major spoilers for Cursed Child and minor ones for Fantastic Beasts but does not require knowledge of either.**

He'd been wandering London for weeks when he sees him. The pale faced child with wispy black hair, skinny shoulders covered in threadbare clothing. He’s soft in the way children are, but amidst the gaggle of little bodies sheltered within the battered gates, he stands with the air of a man grown. Marek glanced at the pinned sign that read ‘Wool’s Orphanage’ and then back at the child. He had seen this boy before, with Evelyn, who insisted on marathoning the films every year, who liked to regale him with stories about the characters. This boy was Voldemort.

This is a Half Blood Prince compliant in which Harry and Draco have some spicy times behind the scenes of JKR’s unfolding plot. I rewrite key Drarry interactions within the book/movie — like the Hogwarts Express compartment and Myrtle bathroom scenes — but with sexy/tense backstories. There is a story, but it's really to set the stage for the sexual tension/dynamic that's the focus. I try to be as true to the characters and plot as possible (knowing that some timelines and details are wrong), but also encapsulate the angsty teen vibes of discovering queer sex and flirting with non-monogamy.Edit: Now that I've written the last two chapters, I feel like the story is important after all and not just the sex (There's barely any smut at the end). I didn't know where I was going with Draco's redemption, but I really feel for him now that I'm done. Thanks for reading and stay tuned for a continued arc into Deathly Hallows!

Lord Voldemort was winning the war, and Harry knew it, at no point more clearly than when he is heading to the Dark Forest to confront his fate. The adrenaline-fueled destruction of the Horcruxes had so far driven him, Ron and Hermione to be able to run, to flee and do what had to be done—no matter the consequences, no matter the danger—to end Voldemort. Harry’s life is about to change, if not in the way he expects because, for every question posed for the fate of the Wizarding World, there will be fleeting answers to trace, and no one is more curious than the tyrant himself.

Harry Potter hadn't had the best of childhoods, that much is known. However, his godfather, Sirius Black, has been staying with him at the Dursleys since his Third Year at Hogwarts. Even Remus visited from time to time. The best part? He stayed in his animagus form, which just so happened to be a big, black, terrifying dog. The previous year at Hogwarts had been hell since Umbridge had taken over the school. This year Dumbledore was back and Harry looked forward to this year without Umbridge being there to torment him, but as we all know, he's Harry Potter. Fate, it seems isn't very fond of him. Although through all the bad, it seems that fate had taken pity on the poor boy it has inflicted so much pain on and gave him something that he's been craving all his life. Love. Albeit, it does come unexpectedly. Not only that, but he also finds friendship in a person he thought had no heart, or brain, for that matter. Dudley Dursley was actually a cool bloke after all.

Snape watched Sirius warily as the pureblood boy looked him over, his hands moving up to rub at his throat as he glared at the boy who’d pinned him to the wall. However, now that Sirius was actually looking he could see the small tremor. The fear that Snape had towards Remus. The scars covered by cleverly placed sleeves the same way Sirius knew how to do for his own markings from his parents. How Snape was alone, just like he was.“Where’s Evans?” Sirius asked warily.“I don’t need her to fight my battles,” Snape snapped at him. Sirius caught it though. The hurt in his eyes. The self-inflicted anger.“What, did you two have a falling out?”Snape blinked before sneering defensively. “Why would I tell you?”Now normally, this was Sirius’s opportunity to mess with Snape, say something hurtful and see if he could get a laugh out of his friends. But he didn’t have his friends with him anymore, and it didn’t seem like Snape did either.“Because Remus is pissed at me right now so I know how it feels if you wanted to talk about it.”

Uchiha Sasuke, for whatever god awful reason, is now Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived. They can't stand water. They flinch at loud sounds. Their boarding school has a lake and is filled with children, who are loud, which means that they are actually in Hell. 
Also, hawks are far superior to owls. Fight me, fuckers.

OR: magic is easy, socialising is Not. sasuke-as-harry would really just like everyone to Shut Up, and also will they ever be able to hear loud noises without flinching ever again? The teachers are getting concerned and sasuke Does Not like that.

Several times. Even in his imagination, it was exhausting. And besides, the food would be ready soon. “I guess that makes you an enigma wrapped in a mystery coated in sarcasm and asine rules.”“Pretty much.” Malfoy gave him a smile.“Want to come with me to get the food?” Malfoy scowled, and Harry raised his hands in defeat. “I know, ‘Questions, Potter.

Gryffindor is that feeling in your chest when you are lost but don't know if you want to be found.Ravenclaw is the breath caught in your throat as a bustling world war to steal it away.Hufflepuff is the lingering goodbye as everything moves forward without you.Slytherin is the silence where you have everything to say but no way to say it.

Harry Potter is murdered, crucified for the last-ditch effort at the greater good. But death is not as black and white as one would want it, not when Death claims you as his master. Harry has a do-over, reincarnated back into his past life, with all the knowledge he needs to piece back together with an old enemy that might just be the only one that can save him from his grizzly fate in 1999. Thinking back on it there really should have been a rule. Don’t travel back in time if you are just going to fall in love with the person that you are destined to kill. And as an add on if you are going to fall in love with them make sure that they stay focused on the task at hand and do not overindulge in dark magic and madness along the way.

A case that doesn't make sense leads Harry, now working for the Auror department, to Azkaban, where the previous dark lord is serving a lifetime sentence, in hopes of help. He had not expected to find Voldemort in the condition that he did though. Voldemort is desperate for a way out of prison which leads to a situation neither of them wanted or were prepared for and they both struggle to adjust. At the same time, a dark new threat grows in the shadows of the Wizarding World. Somewhat inspired by White Collar and the Blacklist but not based on these. Slave!Tom Riddle/Voldemort.

A shadow grew over the sunspots on her book and the smell of cypress and ink filled her nose.

The darkness will always leave scars you can never remove. The scars that live inside your mind instead of your skin. When Hermione Granger looks into the mirror all she can see is a broken husk who allowed herself to be hulled out and left for dead. She despises that girl. She hates everything about her. She hates looking in the mirror and seeing her look back. She hates the way she talks; the way she would shrink herself small enough— lay low enough on the ground and hope, pray maybe it would be enough to be left alone. She didn’t fight. She never did anything for herself.  And when Hermione looks in the mirror all she can see is her.How odd would it be for the man who thought himself her better to fall in love with the broken pieces scattered at her feet when he has been shattered himself? Isn't it odd that without holes, two pieces of a puzzle could never fit together?This is the story of a woman who wanted nothing more than to die, written by a woman who the bravest thing she ever did was live when she wanted nothing more than to die herself.

However, they are only beginning as Voldemort has come upon an ancient, and potentially, deadly ritual, one that will turn friends to enemies, where people could potentially die a most painful death, and one where Harry and Voldemort will once again have an epic standoff.

This story is set 7 years after the war when Harry and Draco are 25.Harry has been repressing a lot of emotions and painful memories after the war. He thought he was fine but over the time he realises that he's really not. Maybe it's finally time for him to write the true story of the war that everyone is begging him for. There's only one problem, he needs the permission of a certain school boy rival of his to use his real name in the story. How will he find Draco Malfoy when no one has heard anything about him in seven years and will Malfoy even listen to him?Draco needs to escape from the control of his father and form his own life but how will he do that without being disinherited? His privacy and his name is very important to him so how will he cope when a certain green eyed man that he's been trying to forget about finds him and asks to write all the events of the war and use Draco's real name in his book? Will he hex him or will he help him?Maybe the book is what they both need in different ways. Maybe confronting the past together will help them both build their future or maybe it will finally break them...Should they share their story with the world?

Lily really wished she understood what possessed her to say what she said on Monday 25th July, 1977. She wished she could find any way of justifying why she opened her mouth and said a sentence that would change the course of not only her summer, but her entire life. She wracked her brains in the following months, running the conversation over in her mind, trying to find a logical explanation for why her brain led her right to those words that she couldn’t take back. But time after time, it was no use. She just said it. And that’s how it all began.Canon compliant (mostly), cliche and fluffy, fake relationship. Jily above all else.

The first thing that he did when he was released is go to the local pub. Ron needed a drink, to clear his head, to gain perspective, to make a plan. He knew he wanted to be with Lily… but there were things he had to do before that. He had to get some money, get a decent place to live, find employment… that shouldn’t be too hard.             'I hope this note finds you well. As you know, my wife is hosting a fundraiser for war victims Sunday and it      would be an honor for us if you came. I know you don’t really like this sort of thing, but it’s not healthy to stay isolated in your home for so long. You need people, and you really couldn’t go wrong with our company. We won’t betray you like others have, you have my word.            Draco and Hermione Malfoy'Well, would you look at that. It would be rude to refuse their hospitality.Ron would play along... for now

With a start, George realized that he’d dozed off. Hermione lay stretched across the couch beside him, and at some point over the last hour, her head had accidentally tipped over onto his shoulder. His lips quirked. The younger witch could use some sleep; she’d been working late far too often at the ministry, and George had been seeing less and less of her around the shop. Truth be told, he was worried. No one seemed to notice the dark circles under her eyes, and the way that she carried her work everywhere. Now, though, she looked comfortable. Content. Her face had smoothed out, and the perpetual line of worry between her brows was absent. She breathed deeply against him, shifting, and her arm came up to rest on his chest as she tucked herself in closer.His heartbeat quickened, although why, he couldn’t imagine.Where had Lee and Angelina gone off to? She breathed in again, and his name spilled off her lips in a sigh, “George…”

This essay focuses on the character, Draco Malfoy, by J. K. Rowling’s famous Harry Potter series, and his development from a schoolyard bully to a victim of war.
Unlike the series, this character analysis will try to look at things from a less Harry-centric view. In this essay, I do not seek to excuse or justify the bullying and crimes committed by the character but do try to find a reason for them and understand them.
My goal is to demonstrate how and why Draco is a dynamic character that is too often misunderstood.

As you know, the dungeons were damaged in the war, which also caused the furniture in there to be, well, gone. We have a shortage, boys. But you are more than welcome to summon your own bed from home or make a sleeping bag. I must be going, I have to check in with every pair of students. Good Luck.” She smiled before she left.~The fic where I completely ignore the fact that buildings can be repaired faster due to magic and also that Hogwarts dorms are shared with 4 other people instead of just one. :) Basically, they are roomies that hate each other until they don't and eventually fall in love.

So when Person B saw A’s head bobbing along to the music, they took it as a yes.So it’s been months of A and B going on dates, and B stealing kisses and A just smiling and letting whatever happens happen. Somehow it gets brought up that they’re dating and A is instantly like “wait– we’re dating?”“Um, yeah???”“Oh cool weird”“What else would we have been? I’ve kissed you at least like 3 times every time I see you. We’ve gone to the movies every Saturday for two months.”“Honest, I was just kinda going with it.

She was like a worm delving deeper into his brain, squiggling around behind his eyes, forcing her way into the darkest recesses of his moral being. The more he was around her, the less control he had over himself. Insidious, that's what this was. These feelings had snuck up on him and rendered him almost a complete fool, making him feel invalidated, making his feelings seem worthless and unwanted. But he wouldn't stop. No! He couldn't.That damned Granger girl would be his, even if he had to kill to get her. Please read the tags. This isn't a happy, smutty, fluffy fanfic. There will be no happy ending.

Not being able to see, to move, to do anything but kneel there and take it all and imagine what he must look like right now—what Draco must look like right now—is as infuriating as it is intoxicating. It makes every sound and every touch reverberate through Harry’s skin as though amplified; makes every brush of fingers tear a moan out of him. Makes Draco’s hands holding him close, Draco’s tongue worshipping every corner of his body, feel like the only anchor to the world around him.

The Hogwarts staff room was perhaps the most secretive place at the school. Not because of conversations about personal lives or badly behaved students; No, the Hogwarts staff room remained confidential because of the professors placing bets on which students would end up together.

A Fem!Harry Potter Story. Every person related closely enough to the Black Family gains the true Black Family gift: The Split. The Split originally started out as a curse, but thanks to the ingenuity of the Black Family, they've turned it into a Gift. What is the Split? It is an almost total separation of one's self into two personalities. One which is normal-ish, the other which is a sociopath. The normal side is used to anchor the sociopathic side, and to keep that side from killing or ruining anyone the normal side consider's important. The hard part is making sure no-one outside the family finds out about The Split.Sirina Potter-Black, in another of her reincarnations, has come back to the Wizarding World to live another lifetime as a Potter-Black. She doesn't realize at first what has changed about her self, but when she re-awakens she must quickly adapt to the changes and figure out how to live life with two people in her head.

The sequal to : The Split. Can be read without reading The Split, but there may be a bit of confusion. Recommend reading at least the first chapter of The Split first.Sawada Tsunako is not what Reborn is expecting after reading his profile. It quickly becomes clear he will need to change his entire plan to tutor the young heiress. The fact that she seems to have her own secrets and secret agenda doesn't help. Things continue on okay until Reborn gets to his second and third Namimori candidates for Guardianship. It was hard enough to make himself introduce Sasagawa Ryohei as a possible Sun Guardian, when he wanted that position for himself. The way Tsunako refuses to even consider Yamamoto for her Guardian frustrates Reborn. The way she explodes on him for introducing a possible Sun Guardian confuses him. What on earth is going on with Sawada Tsunako, Reborn wonders. He also wonders if this will be the first contract he's failed since starting out. It is certainly the most challenging in a long time. Reborn just wants to finish up his job without getting any more attached and then spend the remainder of his short, cursed life, in peace and chaos. Tsuna just wants him to stop showing her other Guardian Candidates.

Not even for a pretty Psy with a pair of the brightest green eyes and the most enticing of scents. A pretty Psy who he shouldn't find so damn pretty...Harry Potter already has enough on his plate with being glorified lab rat and lie detector for the council, keeping his nonexistent Silence from being discovered, and raising two boys he loves more than any Psy should be capable of. The last thing he needs to deal with is a cold war with changelings where his particular skill set is going to be in high demand. But Harry is still a Psy, albeit a broken one, and he knows how to take advantage of a situation for his own ends. If only a particular changeling would stop trying to elicit responses from him that could get him killed, or worse...

Harry awakens to a creature inheritance the night of his 15th birthday, he is now an extremely powerful and seductive dark creature known as a Dark Chimera, will he join the Dark Side now the Light shuns him by default? Will he meet his destined mate? Will he get revenge on those who have wronged him his entire life? Or will he carve his own side and path once he has surpassed the limits of magic in his new form?This story is mainly a Drarry for those wondering about the pairings, there will be implied incest because Death Eaters are still vile and self serving like their master however we will see how that works out as Harry may be Dark but his morals are still one of consent.Let me know what powers he should have later on, Would love to hear any thoughts on the pieces its' a step away from my other creature work however it will still be awesome as Harry has more of a potential to be an OP in this story. Idea mainly came from an obscure story called Compulsion where Harry has been cursed with his body parts replaced with a piece of each Dark Creature the Dark Lord could think of becoming a forced mix of all and having to deal with it after Voldemort is dead.

He could remember how heavy Newt was while the three of them hurried to the other side of the busy street in front of the Woolworth Building to buy three ice creams.He wasn't sure when he had first met Theseus, it seemed as if the English boy had always been there, always been his friend. He had a clear memory of them kneeling on the floor of his bedroom as they tried their hands at magic, levitating Percival's toys and giggling when between the two of them they managed it.

It's Potter's fault, of course, that Draco finds himself trapped in the same twenty-four-hour period, repeating itself over and over again. It's been nearly a year since the unpleasant business at Hogwarts, and Draco's getting on with his life quite nicely, thank you, until Harry sodding Potter steps in and ruins it all, just like always. At first, though, the time loop seems liberating. For the first time in his life, he can do anything, say anything, be anything, without consequence. But the more Draco repeats the day, the more he realises the uncomfortable truth: he's falling head over heels for the speccy git. And suddenly, the time loop feels like a trap. For how can he ever get Harry to love him back when time is, quite literally, against him?

A “stray” obliviate from a dissenting blood purist hits Hermione as she’s debating on the Wizengamot floor for Elf rights. As a result, she loses the last 5 years of her life. Her most recent memory is Fred coming back to life in the Battle of Hogwarts. She doesn’t remember marrying or falling in love with her husband. In fact, when the healer asks her if she’d like to see her husband, she thought Ron would walk through the door. Instead, it was George. This story follows two, parallel timelines. In the first, Hermione struggles to find her place in a world built by a different version of herself. In the other, George traverses before, during, and after the Wizarding War, finding himself more and more drawn to the most dedicated witch he knows. Too bad she's in love with his brother.

It was difficult being the boyfriend of The Boy Who Lived, especially when you have a past like Draco's. Between the mounting pressure of his work as a healer, harassment from the press, and increasing jealousy of the friendship Harry had with his school girlfriend, Ginny Weasley, Draco blew up and walked out of Harry's life. But both he and Harry found themselves seeking bad habits, the need for each others comforts. Except, they were both too proud to say it, instead wallowing in self-pity until an accident forces them to talk.
Inspired by 'Bad Habit' from Ben Platt's debut LP 'Sing To Me Instead'.

The first few months of first year are weird for Sirius in many ways. Like a learning curve that everyone else seemed to have passed years before he even got to it. With the help of his new found friends, he learnt what words were considered 'wrong', that blood status doesn't define who you are (he knew that before, distantly, but it’s been good to get clarity), how most families had vastly different attitudes towards their children than his family does and, most importantly, what a real friendship really is.Sirius isn't from the same families as the other marauders, watch as he tries to wrap his head around what normal is for the others and why he never got the same in his childhood.

 “This is the most stupid thing you’ve ever done!” Hermione yells after Harry. Then she blinks. They’re no longer at Grimmauld Place and, sitting huddled together on a familiar four-poster bed with red hangings, are four teenaged boys, staring avidly at them. Well, this is just brilliant, she thinks. “And you didn’t even get the year right!”Or: the one in which Harry is done with the war and thinks it’s time he got something he wanted for a change.

Minnie is turning 11. She's waiting for that, that thing, to arrive. She's waiting for her family to celebrate the occasion and throughout the day she talks with some people about how she feels. From Harry, to her aunt, to her grandfathers, to the one and only woman who could really reassure her.Little Minerva will be more than alright though.[From the fic: She was filled with so many emotions, she did not know how to cope with the whole lot of them. Anxiety, excitement, happiness, nervousness, she could name them all. The knot in her stomach tightened. She had felt like this for the past few days. She was expecting it to arrive, she knew she would eventually get it, but she couldn’t help but feel this way. Today was her eleventh birthday, a pivotal age in the wizarding world, and her entire, weird, but most loving family was going to come at their house to celebrate for lunch, but her granddads and Teddy would probably come over for breakfast, as they had done every year. ]

Ten years after the war Draco Malfoy is living in obscurity, cut off from most of wizard society and working as a potioner for a healer in London. When he finds himself making mistakes, watching spells fail from his wand, he learns he's suffering from a rare wizard illness that is slowly sapping his magic and will eventually leave him a muggle. Sinking into a depression he discovers a new potion in development that boosts magic along with energy and mood. As his addiction to the potion takes hold he realizes he must start selling it to keep his supply steady.
Hermione Granger works for the Ministry in the department of Unlawful Magic. When rumors start about a drug called Viper's Fang hitting the streets she goes undercover to meet with the center of the supply: The Asp.
Things don't go quite as planned when she discovers The Asp isn't an underground druglord, but her old nemesis, suffering and broken as his magic fades away.

About to enter his senior year as a business major in college, Tom Riddle is placed in a prestigious internship. But his hopes for entering the business world successfully seem thwarted when he realizes that his supervisor, Hermione Granger, is the woman from his hometown whom he obsessed over as a teenager. Written for the Tomione Smut Fest 2020, CEO/assistant prompt.“You must be Tom!” Hermione - his supervisor for the next ten weeks - was far too enthusiastic for 8am on a Monday.  Suppressing a grimace and pasting a smile on his face instead, Tom replied “Yes, I am. Are you Hermione?” The question was mostly for show - he already knew the answer - and when she replied in the affirmative he held out his hand for her to shake. Hermione had a firm handshake. Not surprising, but it did nothing to help his unreasonable attraction to her. They locked eyes for just a second beyond the realm of typical social interaction, and then she looked away. Tom thought he saw the faintest of blushes on her cheeks   Well. He knew what he looked like, and while he might be pleasantly surprised that she was attracted to him, mutual attraction was always dangerous.

A recklessness was unfurling in some dark pit of her heart. *1988 American Muggle Summer Camp Counselor AU, written as part of Rare Pair Spring Fling 2020*

Sometimes all you need is someone who thinks you deserve a second chance. Draco nearly crumbles under the weight of the Dark Mark and the task he has been given.

But there is another constant during his horrendous sixth year at Hogwarts, always around a corner, always watching: Potter. And Potter seems hellbent on saving him.

Back when they were still hunting for horcruxes, cold and lost and hungry – back when everything was much simpler, Hermione thinks with a hint of irony – she used to think that killing Voldemort will solve everything. They get rid of the cursed objects that kept a thin thread of his life within them, Harry does his hero thing, Death Eaters get what is coming to them, and the world goes back to how it was before: golden, and magical, and innocent.

Ifalna knew she only had the one child, the single precious seed of life within her. When she felt the Planet gift her with another, she knew it was for a great task, possibly the Greatest. So she vowed to protect them, and teach them as best she could with the time she had left to her.Aerith knew her little brother was a bit different, but it didn't matter, not to her. He held her hand when she was lonely, and told her stories at bedtime, and scared the scientists away when Momma was too tired for their testing. It was them against the world for as long as she could remember. She never expected that their great duty would be to save it in the end. For Terra Gainsborough, having a loving mother and a sister made saving the world, again, worth the price of being reincarnated.

Third, he kept the Dark Lord’s secrets; he remembers the day they came into his home, the Dark Lord and his cult of followers, each crueler and more heartless than the last, and Draco had been fifteen and terrified, and he didn’t feel like a man, not at all, he’d felt like a child. He’d heard the things they planned, seen the things they did, and he’d kept his mouth shut. He thinks he’d died a little, then; the first time he’d heard someone scream under a Crucio was the first time he realized he knew nothing at all, that the glory and the knowledge he thought were his, what he thought the cause he was fighting for entailed, was all wrong.  
He was all wrong.

Loki, Harry and Merlin have a habit of dying only to reawaken without their previous scars, bruises, or injuries. The soulmate triad dies in battle, once again, in the 21st century  AD on Sunday, May-03-2020. Moments later, King Thor and his soulmate Bruce Banner decide to try their first attempt at Magic™. They intend on saving the Universe from Ragnarök by recreating a time-travel ritual Queen Frigga mentioned to Thor in passing moments before her death. Unsurprisingly the two horribly botch it up. To be precise it's now; June 23, 425 in the 5th century AD. Once again they're living on Midgard's continent of Avalon during the Middle Ages. Well… Well, they haven't lived this long without learning to adapt. Besides, it would be 'beyond stupid' and 'completely irresponsible' not to mention 'unbearably boring' to repeat the actions that led to Ragnarök the first time around. Wouldn't it?

Even up to his death, Severus couldn’t be sure why he did it. Lupin had always been a nice enough fellow, and he did make it a point to call Severus by his real name...but he never tried to get the other boys to stop bullying him. Perhaps it was that bottled up rage and the fact that they were alone that made him do it. Or maybe in his pissed up state, he thought he was facing Potter or Black.This fic will take a dive into why Sirius told Snape how to get to the Shrieking Shack, including some discussion on how/why Snape developed the sectumsempra curse and his first use of it.Title from the song of the same name by Oasis.

Ten months ago, Draco had found none other than Harry Potter blindly drunk and bleeding outside a Muggle pub. He'd brought him home and hasn't left his side ever since. He looked after him, took care of him when yet another nightmare plagued him. 
Harry is sure that Draco will leave him at some point, and he can’t let it happen. He can’t have another person leaving his life unexpectedly. So, Harry forces him to leave — after they spend one last night together.

Now, I wish I could tell you the story of a boy that lived a happy life raised happy and healthy in the comfort of a well-protected manor house in the English countryside. With a loving family and a well-rounded education with lots of friends. But that is sadly not the case for one Hadrian James Potter.As you see, Harry resides in the home of the head vampire Edvin, of the clan Innhøsting. A Norweigan-Russian Clan with ties to the Mafia. Vampires, despite being creatures of magic, are more open to the ways of non-magical people. Because when you've lived for centuries you realise how stupid it is not to.

How exactly did Draco Malfoy end up as a suspect in an Auror Office's case after a year of being presumed dead? Well, you'd have to ask Ron Weasley about it - after all, his intuition is supposedly never wrong. But it's clearly not his fault that the only way to place a homeless person, with a propensity for vanishing, under house arrest, is to find them a place to live. And it was Shacklebolt who came up with the idea that Harry Potter will have to look after said person, so you really cannot blame Ron for this one. Anyway, whatever happened in that apartment, Ron had nothing to do with it - he didn't trust Malfoy from the start, so the fact that Harry was (once again) not speaking to him, because he ""ruined his life"" was definitely an overreaction.[AKA: What happens when you force the Chosen One to stay on home office looking after his clearly mentally unstable arch enemy and how do you even deal with being asked questions you really don't know the answears to.]**Note: I'm taking a hiatus from this story for some time (don't know how long though) - don't worry, I WILL come back to it!**

In the eyes of all those involved in the Xiaolin-Heylin conflict Jack Spicer is weak, pathetic, prone to switching sides at the drop of a hat, and thoroughly unable to defend himself without the use of his machines. And that’s just the way he likes it. It’s a kind of comfortable mediocrity he’s worked hard to cultivate over two years, and it may not be perfect, but it's his.His family, for all their dedication to tradition and high expectations, mostly leave him to his own devices so long as he continues to churn out academic achievements and not make too much of a fuss in high society without their say so. So for two years he keeps a tight lid on his other responsibilities, and enjoys the -relatively- stress-free global scavenger hunt against people he quietly considers his friends.And, despite the risks, he manages to keep it all a secret. Jack Spicer gets to keep his slice of average, expectation-less life, and they get a kid that represents more comic relief than an actual threat. Life is good. Things are nice. And then everything gets shot to hell by the start of the Second British Wizarding Civil War.

His fantasy was sweet, gentle, almost child-like—innocent. He did not need to cry or whine for attention, he had it. A strong tender man would take care of him, adore him, shower him with the affection and love he had been denied his entire life. He had always liked the idea of having someone to care for him, of being able to rely on someone completely. He wanted to go into a more innocent mindset and feel safe, knowing that he had someone else to make his decisions. Sometimes there were too many choices to be made each day, and they exhausted Harry.

After the horror of the Great War, ten people were chosen for an experiment: a gene enhancement of humans, to make them immortal and able to control certain elements: light, earth, fire, water, and many more. The Guardians, or so the project was called. The reason they were created was to protect and maintain peace in this vulnerable world.
But humans' greed and power lust took over the real purpose of the experiment once it succeeded; World War II happened. For the greater good, the Guardians scattered around the world. Burying their powers deep within until it was forgotten. The world had been at peace ever since.
It was 2015. A man named Gellert Grindelwald had an ambition to find all the Guardians, and trigger their powers, so they would emerge for a great cause.
Would they fulfill his call?

“that was really good,” Remus murmured as we curled up in his bed, the full moon still hung in the sky, glowing brightly, we had closed all of the curtains in the room to block it out, and were instead lying under the canopy of his bed, covered by the fabric of his various blankets. “feeling better?” I asked slowly, carefully arranging the blanket to cover both of our bodies beneath it, “so much better,” he mumbled, dropping a kiss to my forehead, “thank you for coming over again, you know I don’t expect you to,” I sighed, rolling onto my side to face him, placing a hand delicately on the scars that littered his bare chest, “I want to be here for you, I don’t care what that means, I want to be here,” he smiled weakly, clearly exhausted. “sleep Remus, you need to regain your strength,” he shrugged me off – just like he did every time, “you need to sleep too, it’s not good for you to keep coming over to tend to me after every full moon, it has just as much effect on you as me,” I rolled my eyes, he used this excuse every time, and I knew it was to try and avoid the truth of the matter.

His heart leapt and hammered against his ribs, if it weren’t for Severus’s insufferable glare he would have probably collapsed in a fit of laughter.

The battle of Hogwarts had started ahead of schedule, and it had taken all of our combined efforts to get as many of the younger students to safety as time would allow before the castle was crawling with deatheaters. Having secured the last of the younger students in the Hufflepuff and Slytherin common rooms, I raced through the castle, skipping multiple sets of steps as I ran back towards the main hall, slowing to a walk, keeping my wand firmly in my hand, I spotted Blaise Zabini comforting a Hufflepuff girl, who was his not so secret girlfriend. That boy really wasn’t as subtle as he’d like to think he was. Approaching them, I quickly caught their attention, “you two need to get to safety,” they looked at me in shock, “we need to fight,” the girl murmured, I shook my head instantly, “we’ve got enough people, and we don’t need more casualties, get out while you still can,” Blaise looked down at me in shock.

They had a year in Berlin, and then Orion ordered Sirius back to England to help set up a new department under the firm's South American division. Sirius had been thrilled when Remus turned up in London three weeks later, shrugging and telling him that he'd tired of Berlin, and something in the grey capital had sparked back to life when Sirius returned from reunion drinks at the pub with James and Peter to find Remus - key acquired from Sirius's secretary, he later uncovered - naked on the bed in Sirius's room, head cushioned on folded arms on the silk sheets, knees tucked under and waiting.Sirius and Remus have an arrangement, of sorts. But they’re definitely not together.

This was a compiled thread that myself and interdimensionalhitchhiker84 (who will be added as a co-creator properly when the option on the profile gets turned on :) ) wrote together after we thought it'd be interesting to take the Fantastic Beasts era threads, based  mostly around magical theory & alchemy discussion and a completely platonic friendship to a thread decades later just after Voldemort initially died.Calleo's career in the Department of Mysteries centers almost solely around the Dark Arts, which made him an ideal person to go to for a frank hindsight look at what had occurred.

As a woman, Hermione Granger had a healthy sexual apatite, but she didn't have time for a romantic relationship.  So she and her best friend Harry engaged in a ""friends with benefits"" relationship as long as neither of them was seeing anyone else.  A rival scientist at Hermione's work feels he would be a better fit to fill her sexual needs, and Hermione decides to give him a try.  If ""friends with benefits"" was enjoyable, maybe enemies with benefits would be even better.

Avalon is a place of dreams and stories: a land of of faerie queens and knights and ladies, a land of magic, outside of time, where everyone is free to do as they will, and the worthy never die. But the thing is, Avalon isn't real. It never was.To accept that there is no island of knights and faerie queens, and that magic is hardly mystical, is part of growing up.To believe that you can reach it is madness, impossible.But Tom Riddle and Bellatrix Black have never had much respect for the concept of impossibility (or sanity).This is the dream of the Knights of Walpurgis: to build a New Avalon, a Dark Utopia, a paradise of magic and freedom and wonder — a post-capitalist anarchy where all beings are equals in the eyes of the law, its leaders devoted to their people and ideals, and followed freely, by choice.A journey to Avalon is never easy — the way is lost in mist: it's easy to go astray.But then, it's just as easy to stumble back onto the path as it is to stumble off of it, and if you're noble and worthy — and above all, lucky — the gods will send a guide to help you find it again. They probably won't tell the guide, though. Gods can be arseholes like that.

Albus' favorite color was silver, no questions asked, no second thoughts.It wasn't because he wanted to show house pride. It wasn't because he was a Slytherin.

Just one shade darker than his father's, but so deep in comparison, like they had layers upon layers of immense pigment.EXCERPT:“Albus, what’s your favorite color?” Rose asked.

Evan's not expecting to run into anyone he knows. Why would he? It's a little Mudblood street in a tiny Mudblood town, and the only reason he's even here is to collect his Mudblood and take him back to the Wizarding World where he belongs. Otherwise, he wouldn't be caught dead anywhere near Spinner's End. One would be hard pressed to find him even thinking of Cokeworth with anything but disdain, normally. Alas, however, because unfortunately for Pureblood, elitist Evan Rosier, he, whilst on his way to procure Severus Snape—Halfblood, damned brilliant and the only Mudblood Evan could stomach being this friendly with—runs into Lily Evans. The Saintly Muggleborn, the Bright One, the Exalted Poster Witch for the Light herself. Well, this won't do at all.Or: Lily Evans misses her best friend. What better way to start mending fences than to invite him to her wedding? Evan Rosier explains why this is an awful idea, (although, admittedly, he is quite biased).

Draco Malfoy stands before him, holding a large paper bag that says 'G U C C I'. She's basking in the pale rays of the morning sun, her straight and what looked to be utterly lustrous hair (which is blond, almost white, and pretty—really pretty) billows, framing her dainty face. She's been sporting an old-school straight fringe, like some Hollywood actress. But unlike one, it doesn't make her look soft or delicate. It makes her look formidable. [An AU in which Draco Malfoy has been in love with Harry Potter all her life. Too bad Harry doesn't share the sentiment. But when she backs off, will he finally have the courage to step forward?]

It's the Tetrawizard Tournament, but Ed is actually more interested in the Hogwarts library. Those pesky tasks are just getting in the way of his research. Also a Yule Ball. Who came up with this again? Anyway, between the Tournament, NEWT preparations (because not even a champion is exempt from those), his research into a cure for Al and his giant if inconvenient crush on one Roy Mustang, their unfairly hot and competent trip supervisor, his year has a bit more excitement than he signed up for. Oh and apparently this Tournament is a giant murder plot, as if he didn't have enough on his plate already.

Being Fleur’s maid of honour was harder than I could have anticipated. My feet finally touched the floor having apparated to the burrow, and I walked to the door, knocking on it quickly, while surveying the scenery. The door opened a moment later, and I turned to face a man I had never met before, “I'm going to assume you are one of the bridesmaids,” he commented leisurely, “that’s right, I'm going to assume you are Charlie Weasley – I don’t believe we’ve met before,” he glanced at me in shock, “correct,” he murmured, stepping aside to allow me to enter. “it’s nice to meet you Charlie,” I offered a quick smile, before searching the downstairs for any hint of where Fleur was, “they are in the kitchen,” he explained, I nodded, allowing him to lead the way to the kitchen.

When small-time singer, Hermione Granger, returns to her hometown to escape a scandal, she reconnects with her troubled past and ends up stirring a chaotic maelstrom that ends with a string of horrific deaths. It boils down to enthusiastic policeman, Harry Potter, and a mild school counselor, Remus Lupin, to solve the murders with the help of the double-edged sword known as information technology.Disclaimer: Some characters have been aged up, some aged down. Backgrounds, family structures, are changed. Other OCs have been added.Note: This is actually an original novel that I posted on Tapas. I was curious to see how it would be received as a fanfic, so I converted some of my OCs to Harry Potter characters.

It’s something that takes time and courage, especially when you want to talk about it.” James pronounced softly. “It’s not that they don’t want to talk to us about it, it’s that they need time. Or, at least, I think that’s what it is.” “That makes sense.” Lily agreed. “I have to say, James, you’re making a lot more sense to me these days.”----In which Remus and Sirius are in love, James and Lily figure their shit out, and Peter does not manage to woo Mary McDonald.

The way his body is just laid out, free for Draco’s wandering eyes to take in all he wants — it almost doesn’t feel fair, just because of how gorgeous the man looks when he isn’t even trying. The tan skin, muscles lax under his touch but still prominent, the line of dark hair leading down where the thin sheet is still covering Harry’s modesty; he’s so easy to look at that Draco’s thankful that he is always the first to wake up in the mornings.
OR: Draco is whipped for Harry and can't keep his hands to himself — Harry doesn't want him to, anyways.

There is a path that all must travel down in life. The dirt road carries on through the countryside until it reaches a fork, where one must choose between a murky path that twists and bends deeper into the undergrowth of the forest, and a straightforward path to a grassy meadow under the sun. Both are equally as trodden as the other. No past traveler can say for sure which is better. Everyone must choose, and the one you choose will make all the difference. Beware child, it is not wicked to wander around in the dark, but do be careful, for it is a treacherous path built to be explored alone. So many have perished in the pursuit of the unknown. Keep sight of what is true for even the purest of hearts can lose their way.

Cheating/Adultery/Affair/DramaRon Weasley's life has been good since the war. Tough, unreasonably hard but good. He had an amazingly smart wife, a job he could be proud of and a family stronger than ever.Then none other than Draco Malfoy showed up in a panic. Next thing he knew his best mate Harry was missing (probably kidnapped knowing his luck) and that Harry and Malfoy were engaged.More problems arise when Ron starts to notice how much time Hermione spends working, How much his mothers health is declining and how much he stops thinking of Malfoy as Malfoy...but as Draco.The cherry on top? Well things start to get more complicated when complex and terrifying feelings start to form between Ron and his best friends fiance—Ron bloomed. “I want to be with you.”Draco didn’t have time for disbelief.

Percy Jackson was betrayed by almost everybody at Camp Half Blood. His girlfriend was unfaithful and overall, there was nothing that tied Percy to Camp anymore. He left America, in hope of never having to speak to a god again. In England, though, Percy learns of an entire new civilization that changes everything that he has ever known. Helped by Hecate and a wizard son of Athena, Percy attempts to assimilate into life at Hogwarts and life as a wizard. With the looming threat of Voldemort and potential death eaters all around, assimilating isn't exactly going right for Percy. Supposed friends look more like enemies and he’s getting in fights left and right from the moment he steps into the castle. As if that isn't enough, Percy learns of an enormous threat that appears at Camp Half Blood. Does he have enough compassion for his old camp to return and help, or will he harden his heart and turn his back on the place he once called home?

“If anyone hears about this, or any conversation we've had I will torture you until you forget your own name.”Bellatrix is halfway through the door when she hears Granger's voice behind her, barely louder than a whisper.“You feel it too, don't you?”Her heart sinks between her knees and she freezes in place, turning her head back over her shoulder just ever so slightly.“I have no idea what you're talking about.”The door closes and the silence returns, but it lacks a certain comfort now.

Riddle was standing in the same spot, his finger crooked towards her and beckoning her back to him. With a gulp Hermione walked back to where he stood. He lowered his hand and smiled as she stood still before him.           
‘Good girl,’ he purred, and Hermione bristled inside. ‘Now, on your knees.’           
Hermione stared at him in disbelief for a second, until he raised an eyebrow and pointedly looked down at the floor at his feet. Fury building up inside her, Hermione lowered herself to the floor, the thick carpet soft under her knees.
One quick blow job, and her cover would stay intact, and by the end of the night Riddle would be in custody.
She could do this.

When Lily and James Potter wake up one morning, they KNOW something is off. Their street is riddled with Death Eaters and their house is in shambles. ""This isn't a normal morning in heaven,"" they think. And soon they'd learn that they were right; in fact, it wasn't even a morning IN heaven. Some cosmic force had ripped them from their place among the stars and given them a second chance at life. But they soon notice that much has happened in their absence, especially to the ones they love. What will they find? How will they cope? Join James, Lily, and their friends and family on their journey to catching up with the times, with each other, and with themselves;piecebypiece. DISCLAIMER: I do not own ANY of these characters! There are no OCs present in this story and thus all characters belong to JK Rowling and the Harry Potter series.

Ursula Black was only two years old when her mother was killed for resisting Voldemort. She is given to her aunt and uncle, Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy, as Voldemort believes they can raise her to be a 'proper' pureblood. But Narcissa Malfoy has other intentions. After Voldemort's downfall, she secretly sends Ursula to live part time with her estranged sister — Andromeda Tonks. As Ursula grows older and the beliefs of one world collide with the pressures of another, will she be forced to choose a side? Or can she combine the person she was raised to be with the person she wants to be? It is a choice she must make on her own — but who's to say a boy with ginger hair and nice eyes isn't worth fighting for?

Harry Evans is a perfectly normal sixteen year old, thank you very much. Except that... he isn't. Not by anyone's standards. (Not when he can make things move with his mind). He tries not to let it bother him, but he's doing increasingly freakish things, and the world around him is getting stranger and stranger. People are following him, and speaking in metaphors, and somehow knowing his name. It's unnerving.He wonders when his life became this much of a fever dream. Or... Harry Potter somehow slipped under the radar, and now, 5 years after that first Hogwarts letter was sent out, they've finally found him. The world is darker, and more hopeless, and the Harry Potter they get seems like the furthest thing from a beacon of light. He's angry and reckless and world worn. But he's their only hope: the saviour of the Wizarding World. If only he gave a shit.

Though the year separating them, Quidditch and Prefect duties, not to mention different houses and friends doesn’t make it easy for the older boy trying to pull the beautiful boy hidden by poisonous words out of the shadows.

Harry Potter loved flying from the moment he touched a broom.  Harry Potter hated being famous the moment he found out he was.  He could never settle for playing quidditch professionally while dodging cameras.  Or for being an auror and having to keep facing people who wanted him dead because of Voldemort.  He ran, he had enough help to become someone new, and he became a normal guy with a normal name who could fly and help people and just be happy.  And then he sat in a chair and he was special all over again.  At least this time the details about how special he was were classified.

It was unknown to most that when the killing curse hit the toddler, the light was already so bright on the young developing eyes that once it landed directly above his eyes, well, that would be the last time Harry Potter ever saw a thing.-Ron Weasley was.... different, from the rest of her children; He grasped onto things slower than Bill ever did, he didn't run around the house like the twins, he didn't reach for everything he could like Percy and Charlie... it worried her, and made her wonder if the Healers missed something when they checked him over when he was born.-""I'm Hermione Granger!"" she yelled, hardly hearing herself. The other children stared, weird looks on their faces, and ran off giggling. Those, she heard, tears springing to her eyes and her hands unconsciously reached towards the large clunky technology that reseted in her ears.

It’s his punishment and he deserves it he knows, but Severus hadn’t thought James would act so quickly in his discipline because his rut had been less than twenty-four hours ago.  But then again, Severus is always on the run when he knows he has a punishment coming and his Alphas know this.  Really, he can admire their cunning because after the rut and the bite that James had given him, Severus knows he’s certainly easier to locate given that he practically reeks of his Alpha.  As sweet and delicious as Severus’ scent is, he’s an Omega and Omegas' scents are meant to be light so that their allure can be jealously guarded by their Alphas scent-marking them.  Such things aren’t permanent, of course, not until they share a bonding heat.  However, during a rut accompanied by an Alpha bite, the scent is much stronger and it’s that scent precisely that had allowed the pack to so easily track him down.OR: After the events of (K)not Me, Severus finds himself in quite the predicament as his Alphas give him a lesson in discipline that he won't soon forget.

Hugo was spared with lighter locks and hazel orbs from his distant mother’s features but still considered himself plain for only Victoire lucked out on the gene lottery.He could’ve spent the remainder of his years at Hogwarts just as normal student, graduate and get a job far away from Voldemort’s reign and the marriage law but no- he just had to get involved with the Malfoys.This story belongs to the [Of Snakes and Lilies] - A collection of series within the parallel universe where Hadrian did take Draco Malfoy’s hand, Voldemort reigns over Britain, Lily is a potions master and the following generations are a pain in the arse much to Professor Knott’s chagrin but not necessarily in order.

LuLu didn’t even warn him, the traitor. Luckily he’s been learning how to deal with the potion for a while now. Everything would be fine, except Pansy and Blaise have no training, and his mother is deceivingly good at brewing. Or the one where everything is getting better in his life until Harry's name throws itself out of the Goblet of Fire and Draco doesn't mind killing his friend if it means keeping him safe

The epic tale of Remus Lupin and Sirius Black, from their first meeting until their happily ever after.A young werewolf who hasn't experienced human touch for six years meets a young pure-blood who's never known how it feels to be loved. The story follows Remus and Sirius through Hogwarts and beyond. Slightly AU in the beginning (mainly Remus believing he can infect people through skin contact), but goes major AU after the events of Halloween 1981.

Rose Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy hate each other which comes as no surprise to anyone. Even if they weren't a Malfoy and Weasley, they would clearly hate each other because they were always tied as top of their classes together, they were rival seekers and they were a Gryffindor and a Slytherin. After an embarrassing moment on the train in their final year, the two find themselves drawn to each other against everything either of them believe and start something that could ruin everything

Remus Lupin is used to having his expectations squashed- they're unrealistic. Who's ever heard of a poor, halfblood werewolf becoming Minister of Magic, after all? But Hogwarts changes this- and a rivalry with a certain Black heir changes his whole worldview.

His fame only increased when year after year Harry and his two best friends, Hermione and Ron, defeated all attempts of the Dark Lord's return. After the war, Harry continued to work his celebrity status to pass new legislation, reform conservative laws, and give sentences to Death Eaters. Hermione quickly rose in the ranks of the Ministry, and Ron had his hands full with a new baby. However, everything changes when Harry sees none other than Draco Malfoy at a charity event, now a renowned potion brewer and collector, although his practice is shrouded in mystery. Harry tries to avoid Draco, but when Hermione and Ron mysteriously grow fond of Draco, Harry must learn to forgive and forget or explain himself. The only problem is, Harry and Draco have some unfinished business from their time at Hogwarts--and that's the most mysterious thing of all.

“Lumos,” George whispered the spell into the clear, night air. The cold silence nipped at his nose, and his fingers shirked from their duty of holding the heavy box. But, even without pulling his wand out, the spell took hold, lighting up the back ally of Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes. The soft glow emanated from his back pocket, illuminating the purple trash bins and brickwork.He took a moment to consider his aims. Just a quick trip, really. Check on Granger. Maybe make her smile. Drop by a few things he thought she’d like.If she was available, maybe they’d work together on their respective projects for a while. He’d be careful not to infringe. The Weasleys had seen less and less of her recently, and she’d left Ron and Hannah’s wedding reception early last week, claiming a headache.But, George had looked up from his friendly conversation with Katie Bell and spotted her from across the room. Her eyes had been red.That wouldn’t do at all.

Instinct, by definition of the Oxford reference, is a complex pattern of behaviour innately determined, which is characteristic of all individuals of the same species. It is also a natural drive that urges the individual towards a particular goal. Animal instinct. Human instinct. At times, a blend of the two. That is what Hermione relies on as she sprints through the dense Scottish forest and harsh spring rain. On four legs, she outpaces the large, ebony wolf nipping at her tail. Shaggy, honey brown coat drenched and weighed her down, yet she continued to remain out of reach of the alpha. Only just out of reach, but she enjoyed an exhilarating hunt, even if she was to be the prey. Of a sense, mostly. TOMIONE SMUTFEST 2020: A/B/O AU prompt

Much later that evening, with Draco nestled naked between them, Theo looked over at Hermione. Draco was fast asleep, curled with his arms thrown around Hermione and his feet pressed against Theo’s shins. In sleep his worried frown had disappeared and he looked years younger. Hermione was still awake, and she smiled sadly and reached over to take Theo’s hand, resting them on Draco’s side. He murmured in his sleep and snuggled closer to Hermione. ‘I hate seeing him like this,’ Theo admitted, and Hermione squeezed his hand in sympathy. ‘Me too,’ she whispered. ‘I wish there was something we could do to help him.’‘I wish we could just keep him here. The three of us could just hideaway here, ride out the war and stay safe.’ If Theo hadn’t chosen that moment to sigh and fall back onto the pillows, maybe there would have been a clue in Hermione’s eyes as to what she was really thinking. As it was, there was a pause before she replied.‘If only we could bring this stupid war to a quicker end somehow.’

Lily had always told James how she wished she could reread her favorite books for the first time all over again. James felt like perhaps he understood that now, for as he stared at the red-headed girl in front of him, he knew he was falling in love all over again. He had been so stupid to let her get away. The Marauders and Lily work for Walt Disney World au. Little bit of fluff, little bit of angst.

After the war, many thought Rosemary Potter would become an Auror, including herself, but on the first day of training, two months after the war, she quit within ten minutes. Instead, she used her inheritance from the Potters and Blacks and some business lessons from the Goblins to buy and invest in businesses in the Muggle World, Sirius would never have approved of her using the money for anything but something that his family would have hated. Her work gets noticed by the Muggle World, and soon she's famous and that gets Tony Stark interested.

As if Harry didn’t have his hands full already, Draco Malfoy has made a comeback from the dead to torment him. However, this is not the Malfoy he knows, this one apologises to him occasionally, and his blasted tanned skin and gold-streaked hair are unknowingly making Harry want things he shouldn’t want. He’s just trying to do his job.It’s been ten years since Harry defeated Voldemort. He has been promoted to Head Auror a year ago, and now into his arms there has fallen a case of illegal memory potions being sold. If he wasn’t busy enough as it was, somehow Draco Malfoy has managed to tangle his name up in the case, and neither of them seem to get rid of the other, no matter how hard they try.Harry is plagued by the realization that while everyone else’s life moves forward, his doesn’t seem to do so, and there aren’t many people who understand what he’s been through. Unfortunately, that one blond tosser with his sneering manner is managing to slowly make himself feel like an inevitability.

Just your typical Nico di Angelo goes to Hogwarts story, except where it isn't. (I hope) Nico just wanted to live a normal life, or at least as normal as you can get for a son of Hades. He wanted to hang out with his friends and his sister. He wanted to redecorate the Hades cabin because, gods it's ugly. He wanted to spend time with Will Solace and be at peace for once. Having his father and the goddess of magic appear on his doorstep smashes any chance for peace. He still didn't know why he felt like he knew the Percy look-alike though.Harry Potter was ready to go insane. Cut off from the wizarding world and then attacked by dementors. He is beyond confused. First of all he has no idea what Voldemort was up to. Second of all he's been having weird dreams lately and could barely remember them when he woke up. Lastly was the whole deal with the American transfer student. Harry couldn't figure out why he seemed so familiar.Takes place after Heroes of Olympus, during Order of the Phoenix.

There were doors left locked in Grimmauld Place because of the horrors that lay within. Sirius, a Black to his core, was much the same.“You know why.”“Yes,” came Remus’ sickeningly gentle and reluctant agreement, “but I think it’d still help if you explained.”“Oh,” Sirius laughed a little just under his breath.

Children are not some Midas touch of goodness, he says into a ringing silence.

“Auror Potter,” Healer Morin said, “Is your interest with this patient personal or professional?” “Both.” Harry replied, chewing his lip as the two Healers exchanged another look.Healer Banks’ face softened as she turned to look at Harry again, “You know the true identity of the patient?” Harry nodded, “Just tell me he is okay. Please?” “Mr. Malfoy sustained severe burnt to a significant portion of his torso and hands. There were some usual properties to the burns that suggest the fire was magically altered. Quite nasty stuff, actually.” Harry felt some of the colour drain from his face and he swallowed thickly. The sound of his heart was so loud in his ears that he almost missed the next words.

Voldemort smiled. It was a cold, creeping thing. Truly human despite it being on a serpentine face.And it was then Harry could see the real Lord Voldemort. Not the madman throwing curses around indiscriminately, but the man who had lured legions of purebloods to his cause, Tom Riddle who had blinded all his teachers bar one.It was calculating. The long-game personified.--Harry would never have guessed that his animagus would have been a snake. Nor the trouble it would bring when Voldemort found out. After all, who needs to kill an enemy when you can keep them?

Pansy couldn’t explain how right it felt. The pure certainty that everything in her world seemed to point to him. Her heart beat for the man. She’d descended into a spiral of chaos when he, for the briefest moment, wasn’t hers. His words had seared into her, and his touch—a touch which felt innocent for so long now felt so different, like it was something personal—hers. It made her want nothing more than to give him everything he wanted, and more. To Lucius, her Lucius. Of course. Of course, it was him.-----Smart, stylish, spirited Pansy was the perfect example of what an elegant Pureblooded witch ought to be. With a passion for match-making, she seldom worried about finding love for herself. So why, when Pansy could have any man she wanted, could she not get her dearest friend and closest confidant out of her head?Modern-era story inspired by Jane Austen's  Emma. Written for Fairest of the Rare Spring Fest.

Draco goes back to Hogwarts after the battle as part of his probation and learns a lot about himself and his classmates.It is a story of healing and acceptance with the characters finding their place in the world after the war and thinking about what they want that world to look like. Things will be difficult at first with tension amongst the characters, many of them still suffering the after effects of the war. However slowly, they will start to understand and support each other as existing relationships continue and new ones form. On top of this Harry and Draco (but Draco especially) haven’t really had any experience of relationships and are still trying to work out their sexuality and what they want from life as they are now able to look to the future in a way they never really thought they could.This story is set immediately after the final battle at Hogwarts and will take us through the next year (and a bit!) after the war. The idea is that it could be the next book in the series after DH, however, as a bit of a twist, Draco is the main character, not Harry. It is canon-compliant with all the events of the books but ignores the epilogue and the later events of The Cursed Child. Full summary inside.

This story is not set in the wizarding world, but rather just ordinary life. Draco is tired of his stressful life as the CEO of Malfoy Company. One day he decides to take a closer look at the small bakery that lies between his home and the Company. He finds the peaceful atmosphere to be just what he needed, and it doesn't hurt that the black-haired pastry girl is cute. However, seeing the similar-looking, but manly black-haired guy that also seems to work there, catches Draco's attention. Who is he? Why did Draco have to stare at him? It was just because of the guy being unusually handsome, right?  That was definitely it...  A story of a tired CEO worker, and a carefree bakery owner.

After the war Draco Malfoy is sentenced to Azkaban for a really long sentence. Apparently aiding in Dumbledore's death overrules any argument Harry could put up for him.After the trial, as the days pass by, Harry is more and more outraged at the sentence. He can't stop obsessing over the fact that Draco Malfoy saved his life and aided him during the war and is very much capable of redemption. Not to mention that Malfoy has always been a delicate git and would never survive Azkaban.After a few weeks obsessing Harry decides that Malfoy indeed can't remain unjustly in Azkaban and starts to plot a way to break him out of jail and hide him in Grimmauld Place. When Hermione finds out she's not amused. Ron is horrified. Draco still thinks he's hallucinating.

The two students walked to the far end of the table casually, slipping in next to what looked like Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini. The conversations slowly came back up, softer than it was before, but Harry couldn't focus on anything but the boy.Not only was his hair different, Harry noticed, but his whole wardrobe was too. The pastel boy had ill fitting robes on, and light pink earrings in his ears. When he rolled up his sleeves, the Dark Mark -a mark that Voldemort had given his followers, was gone completely, in its place laid an arrangement of flowers and what looked like writing.""Did you know he was coming back?""

Hermione was powerful and determined. She liked control and perfection. So much so, that it started eating away at her. Draco was angry. At the world, at himself. He was in pain and liked to ease it. Eventually, it made him numb.Both had issues. Different, but so familiar. They were both trying to upkeep a facade, the lie that everything was okay. They had to keep it from their friends, their teachers, families. All that pressure sometimes just gets too much.-In which Hermione develops an eating disorder and Draco deals with his own fair share of mental health issues and trauma. Set in the fifth year of Hogwarts. Will they find solace in each other? Can a group project bring them together?

“Expose yourself to your deepest fear; after that, fear has no power, and the fear of freedom shrinks and vanishes. You are free.” - Jim MorrisonPercival didn't immediately remember what had happened when he woke up, chained to the wall in his basement, head pounding. He was ashamed to say that his first thought was that he'd gone a little hard on the drink and had taken a psycho home with him.

They did not, however, change nicely or easily or even willingly.Note: Originally written and posted to LiveJournal in 2006; doesn't draw on the movies or anything after Half-Blood Prince (and diverges from that book).

Written for Hermione's Nook Anniversary Drabble Fest. Prompt: It's five minutes to midnight on NYE, and Person A is looking for Person B to give them their first kiss of the year. Just before midnight, they finally find each other.

A bright, familiar laugh rang out over the din and Remus felt his heart leap in his chest, automatically scanning the crowd for a shock of red hair. Despite his protests to the contrary Remus couldn’t deny the feelings of affection, protectiveness and, yes, lust that Lily Evans stirred in him. That he was a werewolf never seemed to bother her, and he had long considered her his best friend, time spent bonding over books and homework and rolling their eyes at the other Marauder’s antics blossoming into  fancy on his part.
Grabbing up the shot that had been set on the bar for a woman paying less attention to it than her date Remus tossed it back, letting the alcohol instill him with a confidence he rarely felt in everyday life before he pushed into the crowd, intent on finding her. Purpose fuelled his steps, Sirius’s words echoing in his mind as a desperate sort of hope that he was right, Lily felt the same, filled him.

In a world where Hunters are aware of the wizarding world, some distrust those born with magic as much as the witches made from human sacrifice and demon deals, while others take advantage of their gifts, and some see them as allies. Two years ago, Dean was one of the first type, until he met and teamed up with Hermione Granger. Now, with his father missing, he has to balance his relationship with a (good) witch, reestablish his bond with his brother, find his father, and when he does -- keep that father from shooting his girl. It's a good thing he can charge his phone in the Impala.

The first time one of them said I love you, they were fourteen. Harry broke off the kiss-- their fifth, the night of the Yule Ball-- and whispered it reverently in Draco’s ear. Draco fake gagged all over Harry, but a few weeks later, shivering from the cold of the lake (“I thought it’d be a toss-up between you or Ron,” Harry’d said), he said it too. Harry pretended he’d just smelled something vile.

A heart rotting curse, if Harry expected to die, it would have certainly been in a painful way. Just perhaps not by one of the worst curses that didn't fit into the unforgivables.Hermione and Ron had at least passed before him, so Harry's not too miffed about dying. He doesn't even mind that their group healer is too magically exhausted to cast the counter curse. It is a complex bit of magic and the healer had been working tirelessly to keep Harry's force of four alive against Voldemort.

Granger. Why did it always have to be Granger who occupied his thoughts?If only she wasn’t a Mudblood. Her being Gryffindor wasn’t a big problem. Her being smart was great, he was secretly really annoyed with how dumb some of the Slytherin girls are. Her being feisty was annoying but he kind of liked the challenge. Her being at the ball with Krum obviously meant that others saw she was desirable too. Her being Mudblood was… Damn. Maybe he was the one with the problem, not her.

She fought in one war, only to be thrust into another. Well... at least the second one seemed easier... Right?Being a half-blood was hell on Earth during Voldemort's war, but she had made it through. She had once had one of the most promising futures as an International Dueling Champion, having already won several trophies and titles. She would even bet that she knew more magic than the Malfoy's. But none of that mattered because her mum was muggleborn. With her parents dead, her home destroyed and no other family, she didn’t have much tying her to Britain anymore.That was lucky since she didn't think she would see Britain again...***Undergoing minor editing but still posting new chapters!***

“There’s a guy…” Sirius started. Remus nodded, encouraging him to go on. “And he’s the most amazing person I’ve ever met. He’s kind, and funny, and honest, and really fucking handsome. But I don’t even know if he’s gay, and even if he is, he would probably never like me like that.”“Sirius, I’ve never met a rational person who didn’t like you.” Remus soothed. “I’m sure whoever this guy is, he thinks you’re amazing.” “I’m not sure. The thing is, we’re really good friends, and I’m afraid that I’ll jeopardize that, if I tell him how I feel.” Sirius sighed.  “I’m gonna go up. You coming?”""No, I think I'll stay down here and read."" Remus answered, pulling out the book he had brought with him. ""Night, Pads.""""Night, Moony,""Remus sat there, in front of the fire, reading for what could have been hours. He kept getting distracted, however, by that feeling, those butterflies that had suddenly erupted.

The room was dark and cold; several figures wearing black robes stood in a circle around a tall, pale, man, and the giant snake resting in his arms. Their faces were concealed by heavy hoods and their heads were lowered as a gesture of respect. They barely dared to breathe, terrified of missing a single word from their leader's speech.
 “There are many prominent witches and wizards who might join our ranks after the school year ends tomorrow. Watch them when they come home on Saturday and report the results to me,” a cold voice echoed in the silence. They knew that the summer of 1978 would be difficult for them, but they didn't realize how their lives would change once they choose the side.

After everything he'd gone through, all Harry wanted was to live a normal life. He didn't want there to be anything extraordinary about him, not one bit. He didn't want to make the papers anymore. He didn't want his name laced into anyone's rumours or gossip. All he wanted was to be at peace for once in his bloody miserable life.When Harry Potter finally finds himself ready to come out, it starts to feel like life is giving him more questions than answers. The last place he expects to find any sort of solace is at Draco Malfoy's doorstep. But something about Malfoy just...feels like all those little missing pieces of himself are coming together in a way he just doesn't think he can ignore.A 30-day Pride-focused Drarry challenge.

“Well, consider me at your service, if you ever need someone to use, say, for exacting a secret revenge on a thoughtless husband.” He smirked, and her jaw may very well have dropped. Had he just offered to cheat on her husband with her?“What? Here and now?” Hermione laughed nervously. The fact that she hadn’t whipped out her wand and cursed him for even making such a suggestion was evidence of how angry she must really be with Ronald, if not of how drunk she must really be. “That’s insane.” At least she could claim insanity later, right? Her heart was pounding now, so much so she thought he must have been able to hear it. She swore she could. She should run. Any decent married woman would. Why, then, did her feet refuse to move?“And that wasn’t a no,” he informed her. They stared at each other with baited breath. Draco took a step towards her, reaching one hand up to draw her towards him.

Draco Malfoy never asked for a second chance, nor did he particularly want one. But he found himself in his old body at eleven, and after a year at Hogwarts, he has a plan for the year before him: keep to himself, find Dobby, improve relations with fellow Slytherins to cordial but distant, get over this stupid obsession with Harry Potter, and no more jokes about controlling a Malfoy mountain troll. No one else thinks they're funny. And no more cursing people- well, only as many people as necessary...Draco Malfoy has never been very good at following plans.

The Sorting Ceremony was very important. However, students were not always sorted where they wanted. -----------------------------------------------Wei Ying was reckless, proud, and shameless, like his mother. The professors didn't doubt that the Sorting Hat would sort him out in Gryffindor. Cangse Sanren was a Gryffindor, like her husband. She was one of the greatest witch of her generation, a Muggle-born: she never let anyone use her origins against her, hating Malfoy and Black for their cult of blood purity. Her death had shocked everyone. When Jiang Fengmian saw Wei Ying, he hoped that the boy ended up in Gryffindor, so he could control and protect him. The Sorting Hat had a different idea,"" Ravenclaw!""Lan Qiren almost choked on his pumpkin juice.

She wants to keep their triad quiet until she's ready to tell the world, but unfortunately for her fate has other plans.  Can their relationship survive jealous lions, meddlesome snakes, N.E.W.T.S. and a year of Friday night quidditch games?  If Hermione has anything to say about it, they'll come out of the other side stronger than ever.  Hopefully fate agrees.

Harry Potter somewhat reluctantly returns to Hogwarts after the war to finish his schooling. It's more difficult than he imagines to find routine again, faced with the realities of living in the space where so many died and so many things went terribly wrong. With a hefty amount of therapy, a lot of aimless wandering, and a redefining of several relationships, Harry does manage to begin to find a new normal, though that normal is somehow no less complicated than his life was before. 
(Or: Harry needs to figure out who he is without the war and his destiny motivating him, and so does Draco Malfoy. Somehow, they end up doing it together.)

They have an idea: Let's drink some dangerous love potion to feel attracted to each other and fuck their brains out to release some pressure. What could go wrong? Nothing, right? Only that Harry slowly, very slowly, begins to realize that maybe he doesn't need a love potion to fall in love with Draco.

Rage: violent uncontrollable anger.Harry was angry. Angry at the old coot for keeping that from him. Angry at his supposed friends stealing from him. Angry that he is placed with those muggles again. His anger was burning him from the inside out and normally he squashed it but not this time. This time, he accepted it, welcomed it. Made it a cup of tea, added biscuits and offered his best chairs. Told it to make itself at home. He also told his welcome visitor, to stay as long as they want. Anger gave a wicked grin. Oh, he was staying for a long time. Labelled as mature - just the themes. I'm sorry if this triggers anyone, I don't mean to. So far, there is abuse. Most likely add more themes in later e.g gore and stuff. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter and co. Just the plot!

Harry wasn't afraid. Not really. He'd never been scared of death, and he knew that he's more scared of his friends being hurt than himself—

“Enough,” Draco said, briefly shutting his eyes. Seven years and he was still as pathetic. He started gathering his belongings. “Excuse me, I have to leave.”


“I haven’t even started.”


“There is nothing for us to talk about.”

A warm hand grabbed his wrist. Draco, shocked into silence, stopped. Harry tightened his grasp, firm enough to keep Draco from leaving but gentle enough not to hurt.


“Draco.” He swallowed. “Stay.”

Harry Potter has returned from his seven-year world tour and is back in London, with a photography exhibition. Draco is not prepared.

In an attempt to aid the returning Eighth-year students for their entry into the workforce, Professor McGonnagall worked tirelessly to create a brand new 'hands-on-project' based curriculum. The paired-off students spend the entire year focused on their chosen project, and turn in a final thesis—in the hopes that they find something they love doing. That Harry and Draco were forced to work along side one another for the duration of their project, with no one but themselves for company, seemed an added bonus. One they might choose to thank her for later.

It's Tom Riddle's fifth year at Hogwarts, and between trying to balance his classes, staying as far away from Dumbledore as possible, and gathering followers in hopes of taking over the Ministry in the future, he does not need the mysterious snake-like flowers appearing on his pillow every morning. He also really doesn't need the Head Boy, Dorian Beaufils, showing up wherever he is, because honestly, it's quite annoying. And what's even more angering, is that it's also quite endearing. No matter that Beaufils' eyes are so eerily similar to those of the monster residing in the Chamber.

Lily Evans was many things. She was a witch first and foremost, and currently – though not for very much longer – in her 5th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was a proud Gryffindor. She was muggleborn, the first witch in her family. She was a talented potion maker, often spending her free time down in the dungeons mixing her brews and revelling in the multicoloured fumes. She was a dab hand at her charm work and liked to summon little sparkling lights to brighten up her study spaces. She was a passionate friend. She was bright, loved nothing more than spending her afternoons listening to records in the sun, and adored being outdoors surrounded by nature. Yes, Lily Evans was many things.But at that precise moment, on a sunny afternoon in June after having just sat her Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L, she was absolutely fucking furious.|| Or, what happened after that incident at the lake.

Hufflepuff, to everyone’s surprise, is rumored to be a top contender to win the inter-house Quidditch Cup. Returning for her eighth year, Hermione is recruited by Ginny and the Gryffindor house team to spy on Hufflepuff’s Quidditch practices in order for them to gain insider information. The only problem is that Hermione knows little about the sport of Quidditch. Disguising herself as a Hufflepuff student, she has an accidental run-in with Draco. He attempts to befriend her Hufflepuff persona, Robbie Fenwick. Leveraging a friendship with Draco, she asks him to help her learn the sport so she can be of use to her house team. Draco and Robbie become friends, but what starts as intrigue for Hermione turns into feelings for him.

Harry had teased him a few days ago, made a crude joke about Draco’s Slytherin scarf that he couldn’t even remember at the moment, but it had led to this.

Hello!  This is a plot outline about Lucius being a mad scientist/inventor who is obsessed about his Hermione doll which he intends to do a human sacrifice to make her alive to be his bride, and oops here comes Draco; perfect timing. Meanwhile Astoria follows him, discovers that Lucius is bananas and Draco is spellbound. She supposes she's the only one around to save the day! I have too many ideas at the moment, but would loooooove to read this story. It's one of the plots I'm less passionate over, so I'd be quite happy for someone else to snap up the idea and write it... as I am knee deep in other stuff... please !!!

This is the Deathly Hallows continuation of my last fic, ""For enemies."" It builds on the Drarry interactions in JKR's plot and then some. Nothing is too inconsistent in terms of the unfolding events, but there are definitely twists. This one has less explicit smut (only a couple of scenes towards the end) but more angst, feelings, tension, and buildup. Also, Draco is, like, capital G Good and definitely more helpful than is probably realistic at this stage in his life.

Lupus Wysteria Malfoy was not your average Malfoy female. Sure, she enjoyed wearing dresses, attending dinner parties, and spending time with her family, but there was one major difference. 
She cared deeply about those her family rejected. They interested her and she did not believe they were beneath her. She wasn't more deserving of magic than they were and she certainly wasn't better than them in any manner. Except perhaps at studying, but that wasn't what the phrase ""better than them"" meant in this situation.
Her feelings grow and grow and soon she realizes she cannot live as her family does anymore.
However, change is not accepted in the Malfoy house and this puts her on the brink of danger.
No side will accept her, leaving her alone. Will she be able to find help, or will she finally be broken?
This is her story.

~“Thank you.” Remus ran a hand through his soaked curls. “Sirius, I-” Come on, Lupin. “I-” Remus walked in, past Sirius, and shut the door. “Sirius, I- Can I kiss you? I’ve wanted to kiss you again for an eternity.”Sirius stuttered a little, and dragged a hand over his face. “Remus?! What-” he put his hands on his hips, his cheeks a little flustered. “What?!”“Oh my fucking God. I ruined it.”~Remus Lupin is a 27 year old junior-associate at lawfirm Slughorn & Fortescue. For three years, his hard work and dedication have gone unnoticed. He lives in a shabby flat, with mountains of student loans, and has already accepted his fate of being stuck in his little cubicle forever when senior partner, and court-room legend, Kingsley Shacklebolt calls him up to his office. Remus then meets Sirius Black, the embodiment of beautify and grace, and from that moment on his life changes. He gets to work with the big-shots, and prove his worth as a lawyer. Although...

Harry’s been fighting tooth and nail for any bit of normalcy he can get his hands on. He’s sick of feeling like something’s wrong with him, tired of feeling different. He thinks he’s finally gotten to the root of it, and has settled into a routine that makes him happy. Naturally, that’s when Draco Malfoy walks back into his life and upends it once again. Has Harry bitten off more than he can chew with his former rival?

Harry was just a 7 year old boy trying to get some sleep before having to do chores. But life is never normal if you're Harry James Potter. Read as Harry talks to Death, gets removed from the Dursleys and put into Grimmauld Place with everyone's favourite godparents, Padfoot and Moony. Hold up, how did he talk to Death!? You better read to find out! Voldemort is 100% dead in this book, but Dumbledore doesn't believe it.

Magic was a complicated and wonderful thing. On several occasions it has been known to not only bend the rules of physics but outright break them, and in more dubious cases it had even gone head to head with the laws of nature as well. On one such night a certain Lily Potter fervently claims that it had rained indoors. This response, however, was only solicited upon asking Mrs. Potter a specific set of questions on what exactly took place on her front porch, February 23rd 1979, after a group of friends met at the Potter home for pleasant conversation and drink. Other responses include: “None of your business,” “Don’t you have work to be doing,” and “So help me, James, if you don’t go away!”

One day, a young girl sits on the edge of a well. On this day, she falls in. Then the next, she’s not even a ‘she’ anymore. He’s Peter Pettigrew — doomed to die at the hands of his (betrayed) friend’s son.Peter is selfish, bitter and brash. He’s not some fairy tale hero, he doesn’t care if everyone around him dies, as long as he lives. The marauders are annoying and childish. Survival is his priority, and he can’t afford to face distractions. This just makes the fact that soulmates are now apparently a thing all the more godawful.(And then another day years later he falls into an entirely new impossibility, Remus Lupin in tow, right into the third book of Harry Potter. Smack bang on the other Peter Pettigrew’s grave).It’s confusing and graceless, and entirely something that would happen to him of all people.—update schedule: have not forgotten, just <3 depressed <3working on the new chapter now

Malfoy turned from her now to her sister. Petunia’s eyes were glazed, streaming unending tears, and her mouth slack. It was as if she had been transported back to girlhood. Gone were the hard lines of her face. Like curtains parting, Lily saw her sister as she once was: wide eyed, curious, and innocent; before Hogwarts, before magic.
  “Now, what shall we do with you, my dear? Shall we show Lily darling what happens when people like her take what isn’t theirs?” His voice was soft and persuasive. He spoke as if to a close confidant. Withdrawing his wand from his robe sleeve, he turned it on Petunia. “What do you think, Miss Evans? Shall we have a quick show and tell?” || When Death Eaters attack her family, Lily must try to protect them at all costs. If only it was that easy. But at least James Potter is there to pick up the pieces.

Harry has been through a lot during his first year. Dumbledore is well aware of that. What he did not know was about the dreams Harry had been having. Dreams of the first year of his life before a once happy family was broken. These dreams of the past, along with protective friends and family are what change Harry's path, giving him and his friends the chance to do more than they thought they could. Dumbledore has to rethink his plans for the Boy-Who-Lived, after the people who care enough to see the truth set his priorities straight. Harry is given a new home, a new chance, and above all a new life that he chooses to base on what he learns of his past from his dreams. This includes rebuilding the Marauders legacy in a new way and preparing for what's to come. It's not like he's oblivious to the fact Voldemort will keep coming after him, right?
