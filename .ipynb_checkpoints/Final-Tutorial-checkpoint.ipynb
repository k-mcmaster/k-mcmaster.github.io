    "Fans are often known for using their talents and dedication to create new media based on the things they enjoy. One of the best examples of this is the writing and reading of fanfiction, the practice in which amateur authors may take aspects from the original content that they enjoyed and transforming them into original works of their own creation. There are various methods that these authors use to share their works with other individuals who also enjoyed the original piece of media but one of the most common is to post the work to a dedicated site for the posting and reading of fanfiction. While there are quite a few options available, we'll be focusing on Archive of Our Own, known colloquially as AO3, for our purposes as AO3's built in tagging and data storage system will allow us to search through the works of fiction using the author's own tags for their work rather than attempting to create tags ourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, since AO3 currently has over nine million works, in order to better analyze the data associated with the site and trends of fanfiction authors, we'll be focusing on writings by fans of a specific piece of media: the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling.[[1]](https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?work_search%5Bquery%5D=) Additionally, we'll be specifically be focusing on the fanfiction written around a specific date in time as there are over 300,000 works for that series alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "On June 6th of 2020, author J.K. Rowling took to Twitter to express her displeasure over the use of the phrase \"people who menstruate\" rather than the word women.[[2]](https://www.glamour.com/story/a-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy) This tweet and the subsequent tweets that followed it came under a lot of backlash with trans activists and fans of the Harry Potter series. This was not the first time that author J.K. Rowling had expressed such views and received backlash, but it is one of the most notable, so we will be analyzing works of fanfiction posted onto AO3 for the two weeks before the tweet was made and the two weeks following the tweet to view the potential impact that Rowling's postings may have had on the writings of the LGBTQIA+ community members and their allies.

    "<b>An Important Note:</b> Content posted on AO3, while subject to AO3's terms of service, is not policed for the actual content itself. AO3's dedication to protect the authors who post on their site means that content posted to the site can contain a wide array of mature content, as most of their focus on author protection are centered around protecting the author from backlash by the original owners of the potentially trademarked intellectual property. Per their own site: \"The Archive does not prescreen for content. Complaints are investigated only when they are submitted through the appropriate channels and with the appropriate information.\"[[3]](https://archiveofourown.org/tos#content) Users are expected to police their own media consumption through the use of the built-in tagging system. This means that some of the information we collect about fics for this project may mention or allude to mature themes. "

    "As AO3 does not have a built in API, we will need to build our own method of scraping the data found on the site. In order to collect the data and avoid unneccesary scraping we'll be using AO3's built in search function to pre-search for works that were created between our dates of interest: May 23rd,2020 and June 19th, 2020. We do this by accessing the Works Search page located [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/search), and entering our parameters into the Any Search field: created_at:[\"2020-05-23\" TO \"2020-06-19\"]. As well as selecting the English language option. This will generate the link that we can use in the data scraper that will gather the information about the works for us, located [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?commit=Search&page=1&work_search[bookmarks_count]=&work_search[character_names]=&work_search[comments_count]=&work_search[complete]=&work_search[creators]=&work_search[crossover]=&work_search[fandom_names]=Harry+Potter+-+J.+K.+Rowling&work_search[freeform_names]=&work_search[hits]=&work_search[kudos_count]=&work_search[language_id]=en&work_search[query]=created_at%3A[%222020-05-23%22+TO+%222020-06-19%22]&work_search[rating_ids]=&work_search[relationship_names]=&work_search[revised_at]=&work_search[single_chapter]=0&work_search[sort_column]=created_at&work_search[sort_direction]=asc&work_search[title]=&work_search[word_count]=). \n",

    "By looking at our search results, we will see that we will be scraping the information about 3,523 works that were created and area available publicly without an account in the month time period we've identified. Below, we will first import the libararies necessary for this project. "

As such, we are only scraping the information that is available from the works search page since that means we only search the number of pages in the search results rather than gathering the content that is available on the works' pages themselves. One such example of information that could have been gathered from the works' pages is the comments associated with the work. AO3 allows for author-specific comments sections in which the author of the work can choose whether or not to allow comments and if they are allowing comments, whether those comments need to come from someone who holds an account with the site itself. While these comments could have had some interested information for us to take a look at, we area already dealing with an extremely large amount of data and the scraping of the comments section would have required that we scrape each individual webpage for the 3,523 different works that we have gathered data on.

    "Returning to our original purpose, we want to see how Rowling's tweets may have impacted the posting of fans of her works who belong to the LGBTQIA+ community. As AO3 contains transformative works, and the original source material does not contain any LGBTQIA+ representation, the best way to view any potential impact is by identifying if a change occurred in the number of fanfiction works posted with LGBTQIA+ content. Especially since authors may have posted retaliatory works in which they transformed one or more of the canon characters within the work to be queer. Below shows one such example in which AO3 author, ughdotcom, posted a work and specified in their notes that the work was posted as a response to something JK Rowling had previously expressed. [[4]](https://archiveofourown.org/works/22817488)\n",

    "<center><b>ughdotcom's Response Posting</b></center>\n",
    "<center><img src=\"ughdotcom.png\"></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in order to best analyze potential responses by fanfiction authors, we will search for the occurrence of various queer identities and flag their presence within the tags so that we can use those flags to identify rates of posting. As seen above, the tags may contain markers before canon character names that indicate an update to something about this character, in this particular work, the character Hermione Granger is trans and Luna Lovegood is genderqueer. \n",
    "\n",
    "As gender and sexual identity expression is constantly changing and evolving, we will attempt to flag for most major sexual and gender identities, but there is the possibility that we may miss some. Our flags will center around the following groups who are members of the LGBTQIA+ community: lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, nonbinary, queer, intersex, asexual, agender, and aromantic. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will also create aggregate flags that will be used to idenitfy if a work was referrring to gender or sexuality or either. However, since the identity queer can be used as an umbrella for both gender and sexual expression that differs from the norm, we will double count its use in both the gender and the sexualities flags."
