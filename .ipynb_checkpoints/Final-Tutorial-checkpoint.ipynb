    "Fans are often known for using their talents and dedication to create new media based on the things they enjoy. One of the best examples of this is the writing and reading of fanfiction, the practice in which amateur authors may take aspects from the original content that they enjoyed and transforming them into original works of their own creation. There are various methods that these authors use to share their works with other individuals who also enjoyed the original piece of media but one of the most common is to post the work to a dedicated site for the posting and reading of fanfiction. While there are quite a few options available, we'll be focusing on Archive of Our Own, known colloquially as AO3, for our purposes as AO3's built in tagging and data storage system will allow us to search through the works of fiction using the author's own tags for their work rather than attempting to create tags ourself. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, since AO3 currently has over nine million works, in order to better analyze the data associated with the site and trends of fanfiction authors, we'll be focusing on writings by fans of a specific piece of media: the Harry Potter series written by J.K. Rowling.[[1]](https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?work_search%5Bquery%5D=) Additionally, we'll be specifically be focusing on the fanfiction written around a specific date in time as there are over 300,000 works for that series alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "On June 6th of 2020, author J.K. Rowling took to Twitter to express her displeasure over the use of the phrase \"people who menstruate\" rather than the word women.[[2]](https://www.glamour.com/story/a-complete-breakdown-of-the-jk-rowling-transgender-comments-controversy) This tweet and the subsequent tweets that followed it came under a lot of backlash with trans activists and fans of the Harry Potter series. This was not the first time that author J.K. Rowling had expressed such views and received backlash, but it is one of the most notable, so we will be aanalyzing works of fanfiction posted onto AO3 for the two weeks before the tweet was made and the two weeks following the tweet to view the potential impact that Rowling's postings may have had on the writings of the LGBTQIA+ community members and their allies.

    "As AO3 does not have a built in API, we will need to build our own method of scraping the data found on the site. In order to collect the data and avoid unneccesary scraping we'll be using AO3's built in search function to pre-search for works that were created between our dates of interest: May 23rd,2020 and June 19th, 2020. We do this by accessing the Works Search page located [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/search), and entering our parameters into the Any Search field: created_at:[\"2020-05-23\" TO \"2020-06-19\"]. As well as selecting the English language option. This will generate the link that we can use in the data scraper that will gather the information about the works for us, located [here](https://archiveofourown.org/works/search?commit=Search&page=1&work_search[bookmarks_count]=&work_search[character_names]=&work_search[comments_count]=&work_search[complete]=&work_search[creators]=&work_search[crossover]=&work_search[fandom_names]=Harry+Potter+-+J.+K.+Rowling&work_search[freeform_names]=&work_search[hits]=&work_search[kudos_count]=&work_search[language_id]=en&work_search[query]=created_at%3A[%222020-05-23%22+TO+%222020-06-19%22]&work_search[rating_ids]=&work_search[relationship_names]=&work_search[revised_at]=&work_search[single_chapter]=0&work_search[sort_column]=created_at&work_search[sort_direction]=asc&work_search[title]=&work_search[word_count]=). \n",

By using the developers tools, we can see that the results of the search are displayed in a class identified as a â€œworks index group\" and each work is a list item below that with the role \"article\". We know that there are 3,523 works to be consumed, and there are 20 works displayed on each search page so we'll need to request the informtion from 177 pages. We split the URL into parts before and after the page number is stored to that we can complete our requests through an iterative process which automatically updates the page number used to request data. Then we initialize a couple new files to store the content from the scraping as we'll be completing it in page portions and that would make it difficult to store as a pandas dataframe right off the bat.
