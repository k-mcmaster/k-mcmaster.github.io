It was difficult being the boyfriend of The Boy Who Lived, especially when you have a past like Draco's. Between the mounting pressure of his work as a healer, harassment from the press, and increasing jealousy of the friendship Harry had with his school girlfriend, Ginny Weasley, Draco blew up and walked out of Harry's life. But both he and Harry found themselves seeking bad habits, the need for each others comforts. Except, they were both too proud to say it, instead wallowing in self-pity until an accident forces them to talk.
Inspired by 'Bad Habit' from Ben Platt's debut LP 'Sing To Me Instead'.

Living in Grimmauld place with Teddy was perfect.  Or at least it was until Teddy started dating their friend Susan, leaving James feeling left out.  A night out and a sick child, James meets during his first placement of his healer training, changes things though. Just not in any way he could have imagined.

Wanting to figure out what she is she performs a spell with unforeseen consequences. Ruing the sister she did not know about's first kiss by falling out of the sky was an odd way to meet.

The first few months of first year are weird for Sirius in many ways. Like a learning curve that everyone else seemed to have passed years before he even got to it. With the help of his new found friends, he learnt what words were considered 'wrong', that blood status doesn't define who you are (he knew that before, distantly, but it’s been good to get clarity), how most families had vastly different attitudes towards their children than his family does and, most importantly, what a real friendship really is.Sirius isn't from the same families as the other marauders, watch as he tries to wrap his head around what normal is for the others and why he never got the same in his childhood.

From Harry, to her aunt, to her grandfathers, to the one and only woman who could really reassure her.Little Minerva will be more than alright though.[From the fic: She was filled with so many emotions, she did not know how to cope with the whole lot of them. Anxiety, excitement, happiness, nervousness, she could name them all. The knot in her stomach tightened. She had felt like this for the past few days. She was expecting it to arrive, she knew she would eventually get it, but she couldn’t help but feel this way. Today was her eleventh birthday, a pivotal age in the wizarding world, and her entire, weird, but most loving family was going to come at their house to celebrate for lunch, but her granddads and Teddy would probably come over for breakfast, as they had done every year. ]

Ten years after the war Draco Malfoy is living in obscurity, cut off from most of wizard society and working as a potioner for a healer in London. When he finds himself making mistakes, watching spells fail from his wand, he learns he's suffering from a rare wizard illness that is slowly sapping his magic and will eventually leave him a muggle. Sinking into a depression he discovers a new potion in development that boosts magic along with energy and mood. As his addiction to the potion takes hold he realizes he must start selling it to keep his supply steady.
Hermione Granger works for the Ministry in the department of Unlawful Magic. When rumors start about a drug called Viper's Fang hitting the streets she goes undercover to meet with the center of the supply: The Asp.
Things don't go quite as planned when she discovers The Asp isn't an underground druglord, but her old nemesis, suffering and broken as his magic fades away.

About to enter his senior year as a business major in college, Tom Riddle is placed in a prestigious internship. But his hopes for entering the business world successfully seem thwarted when he realizes that his supervisor, Hermione Granger, is the woman from his hometown whom he obsessed over as a teenager. Written for the Tomione Smut Fest 2020, CEO/assistant prompt.“You must be Tom!” Hermione - his supervisor for the next ten weeks - was far too enthusiastic for 8am on a Monday.  Suppressing a grimace and pasting a smile on his face instead, Tom replied “Yes, I am. Are you Hermione?” The question was mostly for show - he already knew the answer - and when she replied in the affirmative he held out his hand for her to shake. Hermione had a firm handshake. Not surprising, but it did nothing to help his unreasonable attraction to her. They locked eyes for just a second beyond the realm of typical social interaction, and then she looked away. Tom thought he saw the faintest of blushes on her cheeks   Well. He knew what he looked like, and while he might be pleasantly surprised that she was attracted to him, mutual attraction was always dangerous.

Zin, after Hermione's wise counsel, has decided that a change in leadership is well overdue. Satan is unimpressed. Beelzebub is just trying not to laugh and shake the camera.

A tender romantic comedy/coming-of-age tale in which Hermione Granger is trying to savor her last summer at camp, thank you very much, but Charlie Weasley keeps disrupting her plans by doing sweaty shirtless push-ups on the lawn. “H.” Charlie cast her a sly, sideways glance through the amber gradient of his aviators. “Want to see how Old Blue shifts?”Hermione didn’t care how Charlie’s truck shifted and Charlie knew it, but she laid her clammy hand over his anyway. A recklessness was unfurling in some dark pit of her heart. *1988 American Muggle Summer Camp Counselor AU, written as part of Rare Pair Spring Fling 2020*

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizadry, like any other modern school, has an all inclusive curriculum. Explained in this innuendo laden story is how it is related to why certain Gryffindors can't sleep. And how across three generations, everyone fails at adulting.OrEveryone has midnight realisations, but the Gryffindors have been having them at exactly 2.15am for years. The realisations are all different but the reason is the same.

It was all Rose's idea, really. ""Try a different style, to get his attention. You never know, something might happen."", also suggesting it as a way to finally find his aesthetic. She was both right and wrong. Month one and two consisted of goth and hippie, but they were only able to get Scorpius flustered, sporting a very impressive blush. Nothing more happened.""Third time's the charm"", or so they say. Albus would have to think of something that made him resemble a sex god if he wanted Scorpius to notice him as something more than a friend.

They sped up and the warm wind really began to move through the car, picking up Millie’s hair and swirling it around her face. “Aack!” she gave a little cry of dismay as she tried to rein it in, twisting it down to the side and holding it there.Oliver glanced at her. “Your hair is a real, true black,” he said. “No brown at all. It’s almost blue in the sun.”Millie’s mouth dropped open in surprise. He had noticed her hair? Enough to note the specifics of the color? Her mind was reeling, but all her mouth could say was, “Yeah. It’s really dark.”“Yeah.” He looked at the road again, squinting against the brightness of the midday sun. “It’s really beautiful.”

Sometimes a single decision can change your whole history. Sometimes a simple question and a little bit of insistence can make all the difference. Sometimes all you need is someone who thinks you deserve a second chance. Draco nearly crumbles under the weight of the Dark Mark and the task he has been given. It’s like a constant weight on his shoulders that just would not let him breathe, would not budge, no matter how hard he tries. But there is another constant during his horrendous sixth year at Hogwarts, always around a corner, always watching: Potter. And Potter seems hellbent on saving him.

Ifalna knew she only had the one child, the single precious seed of life within her. When she felt the Planet gift her with another, she knew it was for a great task, possibly the Greatest. So she vowed to protect them, and teach them as best she could with the time she had left to her.Aerith knew her little brother was a bit different, but it didn't matter, not to her. He held her hand when she was lonely, and told her stories at bedtime, and scared the scientists away when Momma was too tired for their testing. It was them against the world for as long as she could remember. She never expected that their great duty would be to save it in the end. For Terra Gainsborough, having a loving mother and a sister made saving the world, again, worth the price of being reincarnated.

Third, he kept the Dark Lord’s secrets; he remembers the day they came into his home, the Dark Lord and his cult of followers, each crueler and more heartless than the last, and Draco had been fifteen and terrified, and he didn’t feel like a man, not at all, he’d felt like a child. He’d heard the things they planned, seen the things they did, and he’d kept his mouth shut. He thinks he’d died a little, then; the first time he’d heard someone scream under a Crucio was the first time he realized he knew nothing at all, that the glory and the knowledge he thought were his, what he thought the cause he was fighting for entailed, was all wrong.

Loki, Harry and Merlin have a habit of dying only to reawaken without their previous scars, bruises, or injuries. The soulmate triad dies in battle, once again, in the 21st century  AD on Sunday, May-03-2020. Moments later, King Thor and his soulmate Bruce Banner decide to try their first attempt at Magic™. They intend on saving the Universe from Ragnarök by recreating a time-travel ritual Queen Frigga mentioned to Thor in passing moments before her death. Unsurprisingly the two horribly botch it up. To be precise it's now; June 23, 425 in the 5th century AD. Once again they're living on Midgard's continent of Avalon during the Middle Ages. Well… Well, they haven't lived this long without learning to adapt. Besides, it would be 'beyond stupid' and 'completely irresponsible' not to mention 'unbearably boring' to repeat the actions that led to Ragnarök the first time around. Wouldn't it?

Even up to his death, Severus couldn’t be sure why he did it. Lupin had always been a nice enough fellow, and he did make it a point to call Severus by his real name...but he never tried to get the other boys to stop bullying him. Perhaps it was that bottled up rage and the fact that they were alone that made him do it. Or maybe in his pissed up state, he thought he was facing Potter or Black.This fic will take a dive into why Sirius told Snape how to get to the Shrieking Shack, including some discussion on how/why Snape developed the sectumsempra curse and his first use of it.Title from the song of the same name by Oasis.

Ten months ago, Draco had found none other than Harry Potter blindly drunk and bleeding outside a Muggle pub. He'd brought him home and hasn't left his side ever since. He looked after him, took care of him when yet another nightmare plagued him. 
Harry is sure that Draco will leave him at some point, and he can’t let it happen. He can’t have another person leaving his life unexpectedly. So, Harry forces him to leave — after they spend one last night together.

How exactly did Draco Malfoy end up as a suspect in an Auror Office's case after a year of being presumed dead? Well, you'd have to ask Ron Weasley about it - after all, his intuition is supposedly never wrong. But it's clearly not his fault that the only way to place a homeless person, with a propensity for vanishing, under house arrest, is to find them a place to live. And it was Shacklebolt who came up with the idea that Harry Potter will have to look after said person, so you really cannot blame Ron for this one. Anyway, whatever happened in that apartment, Ron had nothing to do with it - he didn't trust Malfoy from the start, so the fact that Harry was (once again) not speaking to him, because he ""ruined his life"" was definitely an overreaction.[AKA: What happens when you force the Chosen One to stay on home office looking after his clearly mentally unstable arch enemy and how do you even deal with being asked questions you really don't know the answears to.]**Note: I'm taking a hiatus from this story for some time (don't know how long though) - don't worry, I WILL come back to it!**

In the eyes of all those involved in the Xiaolin-Heylin conflict Jack Spicer is weak, pathetic, prone to switching sides at the drop of a hat, and thoroughly unable to defend himself without the use of his machines. And that’s just the way he likes it. It’s a kind of comfortable mediocrity he’s worked hard to cultivate over two years, and it may not be perfect, but it's his.His family, for all their dedication to tradition and high expectations, mostly leave him to his own devices so long as he continues to churn out academic achievements and not make too much of a fuss in high society without their say so. So for two years he keeps a tight lid on his other responsibilities, and enjoys the -relatively- stress-free global scavenger hunt against people he quietly considers his friends.And, despite the risks, he manages to keep it all a secret. Jack Spicer gets to keep his slice of average, expectation-less life, and they get a kid that represents more comic relief than an actual threat. Life is good. Things are nice. And then everything gets shot to hell by the start of the Second British Wizarding Civil War.

His fantasy was sweet, gentle, almost child-like—innocent. He did not need to cry or whine for attention, he had it. A strong tender man would take care of him, adore him, shower him with the affection and love he had been denied his entire life. He had always liked the idea of having someone to care for him, of being able to rely on someone completely. He wanted to go into a more innocent mindset and feel safe, knowing that he had someone else to make his decisions. Sometimes there were too many choices to be made each day, and they exhausted Harry.

After the horror of the Great War, ten people were chosen for an experiment: a gene enhancement of humans, to make them immortal and able to control certain elements: light, earth, fire, water, and many more. The Guardians, or so the project was called. The reason they were created was to protect and maintain peace in this vulnerable world.
But humans' greed and power lust took over the real purpose of the experiment once it succeeded; World War II happened. For the greater good, the Guardians scattered around the world. Burying their powers deep within until it was forgotten. The world had been at peace ever since.
It was 2015. A man named Gellert Grindelwald had an ambition to find all the Guardians, and trigger their powers, so they would emerge for a great cause.
Would they fulfill his call?

Didn’t dare try to cross the thin line between friendship and something else.They had eventually crossed it, and in many ways the war had been simpler than what had then unfolded.

“that was really good,” Remus murmured as we curled up in his bed, the full moon still hung in the sky, glowing brightly, we had closed all of the curtains in the room to block it out, and were instead lying under the canopy of his bed, covered by the fabric of his various blankets. “feeling better?” I asked slowly, carefully arranging the blanket to cover both of our bodies beneath it, “so much better,” he mumbled, dropping a kiss to my forehead, “thank you for coming over again, you know I don’t expect you to,” I sighed, rolling onto my side to face him, placing a hand delicately on the scars that littered his bare chest, “I want to be here for you, I don’t care what that means, I want to be here,” he smiled weakly, clearly exhausted. “sleep Remus, you need to regain your strength,” he shrugged me off – just like he did every time, “you need to sleep too, it’s not good for you to keep coming over to tend to me after every full moon, it has just as much effect on you as me,” I rolled my eyes, he used this excuse every time, and I knew it was to try and avoid the truth of the matter.

The battle of Hogwarts had started ahead of schedule, and it had taken all of our combined efforts to get as many of the younger students to safety as time would allow before the castle was crawling with deatheaters. Having secured the last of the younger students in the Hufflepuff and Slytherin common rooms, I raced through the castle, skipping multiple sets of steps as I ran back towards the main hall, slowing to a walk, keeping my wand firmly in my hand, I spotted Blaise Zabini comforting a Hufflepuff girl, who was his not so secret girlfriend. That boy really wasn’t as subtle as he’d like to think he was. Approaching them, I quickly caught their attention, “you two need to get to safety,” they looked at me in shock, “we need to fight,” the girl murmured, I shook my head instantly, “we’ve got enough people, and we don’t need more casualties, get out while you still can,” Blaise looked down at me in shock.

Avalon is a place of dreams and stories: a land of of faerie queens and knights and ladies, a land of magic, outside of time, where everyone is free to do as they will, and the worthy never die. But the thing is, Avalon isn't real. It never was.To accept that there is no island of knights and faerie queens, and that magic is hardly mystical, is part of growing up.To believe that you can reach it is madness, impossible.But Tom Riddle and Bellatrix Black have never had much respect for the concept of impossibility (or sanity).This is the dream of the Knights of Walpurgis: to build a New Avalon, a Dark Utopia, a paradise of magic and freedom and wonder — a post-capitalist anarchy where all beings are equals in the eyes of the law, its leaders devoted to their people and ideals, and followed freely, by choice.A journey to Avalon is never easy — the way is lost in mist: it's easy to go astray.But then, it's just as easy to stumble back onto the path as it is to stumble off of it, and if you're noble and worthy — and above all, lucky — the gods will send a guide to help you find it again. They probably won't tell the guide, though. Gods can be arseholes like that.

Albus' favorite color was silver, no questions asked, no second thoughts.It wasn't because he wanted to show house pride. It wasn't because he was a Slytherin. No. It was because he loved silver, the exact shade of silver that was contained in Scorpius' eyes.Scorpius' favorite color was green, but not just green, emerald green, and a deep shade of it.He loved that deep, dark shade of green because it was the exact color of Albus' eyes. Just one shade darker than his father's, but so deep in comparison, like they had layers upon layers of immense pigment.EXCERPT:“Albus, what’s your favorite color?” Rose asked. ""I just want to know what I should get you for your birthday."" “It’s silver,” Albus said, ""but just get me candy for my birthday."" “Such a Slytherin,” Rose teased. “Showing house pride.” “Yeah.” Albus sighed, looking over at his beautiful (secret)  boyfriend. Scorpius was wearing sunglasses, but if he weren’t his bright silver eyes would’ve been glinting in the sunlight. “House pride.”

Evan's not expecting to run into anyone he knows. Why would he? It's a little Mudblood street in a tiny Mudblood town, and the only reason he's even here is to collect his Mudblood and take him back to the Wizarding World where he belongs. Otherwise, he wouldn't be caught dead anywhere near Spinner's End. One would be hard pressed to find him even thinking of Cokeworth with anything but disdain, normally. Alas, however, because unfortunately for Pureblood, elitist Evan Rosier, he, whilst on his way to procure Severus Snape—Halfblood, damned brilliant and the only Mudblood Evan could stomach being this friendly with—runs into Lily Evans. The Saintly Muggleborn, the Bright One, the Exalted Poster Witch for the Light herself. Well, this won't do at all.Or: Lily Evans misses her best friend. What better way to start mending fences than to invite him to her wedding? Evan Rosier explains why this is an awful idea, (although, admittedly, he is quite biased).

Draco Malfoy stands before him, holding a large paper bag that says 'G U C C I'. She's basking in the pale rays of the morning sun, her straight and what looked to be utterly lustrous hair (which is blond, almost white, and pretty—really pretty) billows, framing her dainty face. She's been sporting an old-school straight fringe, like some Hollywood actress. But unlike one, it doesn't make her look soft or delicate. It makes her look formidable. [An AU in which Draco Malfoy has been in love with Harry Potter all her life. Too bad Harry doesn't share the sentiment. But when she backs off, will he finally have the courage to step forward?]

It's the Tetrawizard Tournament, but Ed is actually more interested in the Hogwarts library. Those pesky tasks are just getting in the way of his research. Also a Yule Ball. Who came up with this again? Anyway, between the Tournament, NEWT preparations (because not even a champion is exempt from those), his research into a cure for Al and his giant if inconvenient crush on one Roy Mustang, their unfairly hot and competent trip supervisor, his year has a bit more excitement than he signed up for. Oh and apparently this Tournament is a giant murder plot, as if he didn't have enough on his plate already.

Being Fleur’s maid of honour was harder than I could have anticipated. My feet finally touched the floor having apparated to the burrow, and I walked to the door, knocking on it quickly, while surveying the scenery. The door opened a moment later, and I turned to face a man I had never met before, “I'm going to assume you are one of the bridesmaids,” he commented leisurely, “that’s right, I'm going to assume you are Charlie Weasley – I don’t believe we’ve met before,” he glanced at me in shock, “correct,” he murmured, stepping aside to allow me to enter. “it’s nice to meet you Charlie,” I offered a quick smile, before searching the downstairs for any hint of where Fleur was, “they are in the kitchen,” he explained, I nodded, allowing him to lead the way to the kitchen.

When small-time singer, Hermione Granger, returns to her hometown to escape a scandal, she reconnects with her troubled past and ends up stirring a chaotic maelstrom that ends with a string of horrific deaths. It boils down to enthusiastic policeman, Harry Potter, and a mild school counselor, Remus Lupin, to solve the murders with the help of the double-edged sword known as information technology.Disclaimer: Some characters have been aged up, some aged down. Backgrounds, family structures, are changed. Other OCs have been added.Note: This is actually an original novel that I posted on Tapas. I was curious to see how it would be received as a fanfic, so I converted some of my OCs to Harry Potter characters.

Draco's life has been one big mess ever since Potter broke up with him. He doesn't want to see his friends, he's too ashamed to see his parents, and his apartment is one giant mess.

Ron nods once. “I kept thinking what if I trip and fall?“ he chuckles at the memory.

OR: Draco is whipped for Harry and can't keep his hands to himself — Harry doesn't want him to, anyways.

The owner of this flower shop is none other than the soft blonde haired Draco Malfoy.If only he knew it were that easy when you fell in love... Will Harry visit Draco enough times to be told about the blonde’s favourite flower? And just enough times to not be head over heels for him? (Hint : the second answer is absolutely not.)

They’re barely nine when it really strikes Fred for the first time that they look remarkably similar. “Say, Georgie — what’s it like being so handsome?” George looks up from the broom he’s trying to glare into submission, and his face scrunches up for a second, staring at Fred with obvious confusion. Then it evens out, splitting into a smile that pulls higher towards his right ear than his left. “Well, I don’t know, Freddie; why don’t you tell me?”

There is a path that all must travel down in life. The dirt road carries on through the countryside until it reaches a fork, where one must choose between a murky path that twists and bends deeper into the undergrowth of the forest, and a straightforward path to a grassy meadow under the sun. Both are equally as trodden as the other. No past traveler can say for sure which is better. Everyone must choose, and the one you choose will make all the difference. Beware child, it is not wicked to wander around in the dark, but do be careful, for it is a treacherous path built to be explored alone. So many have perished in the pursuit of the unknown. Keep sight of what is true for even the purest of hearts can lose their way.

Cheating/Adultery/Affair/DramaRon Weasley's life has been good since the war. Tough, unreasonably hard but good. He had an amazingly smart wife, a job he could be proud of and a family stronger than ever.Then none other than Draco Malfoy showed up in a panic. Next thing he knew his best mate Harry was missing (probably kidnapped knowing his luck) and that Harry and Malfoy were engaged.More problems arise when Ron starts to notice how much time Hermione spends working, How much his mothers health is declining and how much he stops thinking of Malfoy as Malfoy...but as Draco.The cherry on top? Well things start to get more complicated when complex and terrifying feelings start to form between Ron and his best friends fiance—Ron bloomed. “I want to be with you.”Draco didn’t have time for disbelief.

Percy Jackson was betrayed by almost everybody at Camp Half Blood. His girlfriend was unfaithful and overall, there was nothing that tied Percy to Camp anymore. He left America, in hope of never having to speak to a god again. In England, though, Percy learns of an entire new civilization that changes everything that he has ever known. Helped by Hecate and a wizard son of Athena, Percy attempts to assimilate into life at Hogwarts and life as a wizard. With the looming threat of Voldemort and potential death eaters all around, assimilating isn't exactly going right for Percy. Supposed friends look more like enemies and he’s getting in fights left and right from the moment he steps into the castle. As if that isn't enough, Percy learns of an enormous threat that appears at Camp Half Blood. Does he have enough compassion for his old camp to return and help, or will he harden his heart and turn his back on the place he once called home?

Riddle was standing in the same spot, his finger crooked towards her and beckoning her back to him. With a gulp Hermione walked back to where he stood. He lowered his hand and smiled as she stood still before him.           
‘Good girl,’ he purred, and Hermione bristled inside. ‘Now, on your knees.’           
Hermione stared at him in disbelief for a second, until he raised an eyebrow and pointedly looked down at the floor at his feet. Fury building up inside her, Hermione lowered herself to the floor, the thick carpet soft under her knees.
One quick blow job, and her cover would stay intact, and by the end of the night Riddle would be in custody.
She could do this.

When Lily and James Potter wake up one morning, they KNOW something is off. Their street is riddled with Death Eaters and their house is in shambles. ""This isn't a normal morning in heaven,"" they think. And soon they'd learn that they were right; in fact, it wasn't even a morning IN heaven. Some cosmic force had ripped them from their place among the stars and given them a second chance at life. But they soon notice that much has happened in their absence, especially to the ones they love. What will they find? How will they cope? Join James, Lily, and their friends and family on their journey to catching up with the times, with each other, and with themselves;piecebypiece. DISCLAIMER: I do not own ANY of these characters! There are no OCs present in this story and thus all characters belong to JK Rowling and the Harry Potter series.

Ursula Black was only two years old when her mother was killed for resisting Voldemort. She is given to her aunt and uncle, Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy, as Voldemort believes they can raise her to be a 'proper' pureblood. But Narcissa Malfoy has other intentions. After Voldemort's downfall, she secretly sends Ursula to live part time with her estranged sister — Andromeda Tonks. As Ursula grows older and the beliefs of one world collide with the pressures of another, will she be forced to choose a side? Or can she combine the person she was raised to be with the person she wants to be? It is a choice she must make on her own — but who's to say a boy with ginger hair and nice eyes isn't worth fighting for?

Harry Evans is a perfectly normal sixteen year old, thank you very much. Except that... he isn't. Not by anyone's standards. (Not when he can make things move with his mind). He tries not to let it bother him, but he's doing increasingly freakish things, and the world around him is getting stranger and stranger. People are following him, and speaking in metaphors, and somehow knowing his name. It's unnerving.He wonders when his life became this much of a fever dream. Or... Harry Potter somehow slipped under the radar, and now, 5 years after that first Hogwarts letter was sent out, they've finally found him. The world is darker, and more hopeless, and the Harry Potter they get seems like the furthest thing from a beacon of light. He's angry and reckless and world worn. But he's their only hope: the saviour of the Wizarding World. If only he gave a shit.

But when his childhood rival who disappeared mysteriously during Castien's fourth year returns to finish out her Hogwarts education, Castien's plans find themselves in disarray. Her reappearance in his life reignites their rivalry and brings back so many memories...except the one that would explain why they are rivals in the first place.

Harry Potter loved flying from the moment he touched a broom.  Harry Potter hated being famous the moment he found out he was.  He could never settle for playing quidditch professionally while dodging cameras.  Or for being an auror and having to keep facing people who wanted him dead because of Voldemort.  He ran, he had enough help to become someone new, and he became a normal guy with a normal name who could fly and help people and just be happy.  And then he sat in a chair and he was special all over again.  At least this time the details about how special he was were classified.

And a story about Harry, well, not hating his job per say, but it's not like he has much to compare it to and it seemed fine. His whole life seemed fine. Then Malfoy came along with and his flashy suits and fast car making everything seem dull in comparison, and Harry... Harry couldn't just leave well enough alone.

Eighth year, picks up following the Battle of Hogwarts. Unsettled and not sure what his new normal is or should be, Harry is granted refuge at Hogwarts for the summer by Professor McGonagall. Keeping himself at a distance from the rest of the wizarding world and helping the Department of Magical Architecture restore the castle and grounds, he begins to process the last seven years of his life without anyone else's input, which challenges him to begin looking at things, and people, differently. Story then tracks into eighth year and beyond, particularly centering around the most challenging relationship he has to make peace with: Malfoy.

It was unknown to most that when the killing curse hit the toddler, the light was already so bright on the young developing eyes that once it landed directly above his eyes, well, that would be the last time Harry Potter ever saw a thing.-Ron Weasley was.... different, from the rest of her children; He grasped onto things slower than Bill ever did, he didn't run around the house like the twins, he didn't reach for everything he could like Percy and Charlie... it worried her, and made her wonder if the Healers missed something when they checked him over when he was born.-""I'm Hermione Granger!"" she yelled, hardly hearing herself. The other children stared, weird looks on their faces, and ran off giggling. Those, she heard, tears springing to her eyes and her hands unconsciously reached towards the large clunky technology that reseted in her ears.

It’s his punishment and he deserves it he knows, but Severus hadn’t thought James would act so quickly in his discipline because his rut had been less than twenty-four hours ago.  But then again, Severus is always on the run when he knows he has a punishment coming and his Alphas know this.  Really, he can admire their cunning because after the rut and the bite that James had given him, Severus knows he’s certainly easier to locate given that he practically reeks of his Alpha.  As sweet and delicious as Severus’ scent is, he’s an Omega and Omegas' scents are meant to be light so that their allure can be jealously guarded by their Alphas scent-marking them.  Such things aren’t permanent, of course, not until they share a bonding heat.  However, during a rut accompanied by an Alpha bite, the scent is much stronger and it’s that scent precisely that had allowed the pack to so easily track him down.OR: After the events of (K)not Me, Severus finds himself in quite the predicament as his Alphas give him a lesson in discipline that he won't soon forget.

Snape recovers, and just wants everything to calm down so he can get back to teaching, reading and brewing.Hermione realizes that Ron was not the man she thought he was, and is offered a post at Hogwarts. She has nowhere else to go, but nowhere she would rather be. With everyone moving on, all the more quickly due to the new Marriage Law and having left school, she is on her own. At least she still has a good book and a cup of tea, but maybe something more is on its, his, way.

Texas was a jarring change. It was hot in the Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring and when it wasn't boiling hot, it was hailing or flooding. Well, that wasn't fair. The weather could be kind, clear and sunny with a cool breeze, the kind of breeze that he relished blowing through the window in his potions lab in the afternoon.He had grown used to the Texan heat, the Cedar fever he didn't even know was a thing, the sounds of children playing outside at all hours and his overly kind neighbors.

He didn’t know how he got himself into this predicament, much like when Castor’s name was called during the reaping at the goblet of fire.Hugo Ronald Weasley was a normal half-blood wizard of the Gryffindor House, not as overachieving as his mean older sister is but he did take pride excelling in Care of Magical Creatures. Like all other Weasleys; he grew up with a number of family members looking like each other’s carbon copy- signature ginger hair, freckles, and brown eyes. Hugo was spared with lighter locks and hazel orbs from his distant mother’s features but still considered himself plain for only Victoire lucked out on the gene lottery.He could’ve spent the remainder of his years at Hogwarts just as normal student, graduate and get a job far away from Voldemort’s reign and the marriage law but no- he just had to get involved with the Malfoys.This story belongs to the [Of Snakes and Lilies] - A collection of series within the parallel universe where Hadrian did take Draco Malfoy’s hand, Voldemort reigns over Britain, Lily is a potions master and the following generations are a pain in the arse much to Professor Knott’s chagrin but not necessarily in order.

Meanwhile old rivalries are stirred up at Hogwarts when the first Malfoy for generations is sorted into Gryffindor.The war may be history, but old grudges run deep, divides are at best patched over, and some actions of the past may just be unforgivable.Updates roughly once a week, but no promises.

“I’m not.” Harry is. He just - he can’t see it. 
“You can’t see it yet, Potter.” Malfoy sounds miffed.  
“I’m not trying to,” Harry lies, finally tearing his eyes away; he looks out the window in a desperate attempt to get a single thought into his head that isn’t what the fuck.

Rose Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy hate each other which comes as no surprise to anyone. Even if they weren't a Malfoy and Weasley, they would clearly hate each other because they were always tied as top of their classes together, they were rival seekers and they were a Gryffindor and a Slytherin. After an embarrassing moment on the train in their final year, the two find themselves drawn to each other against everything either of them believe and start something that could ruin everything

Remus Lupin is used to having his expectations squashed- they're unrealistic. Who's ever heard of a poor, halfblood werewolf becoming Minister of Magic, after all? But Hogwarts changes this- and a rivalry with a certain Black heir changes his whole worldview. What, and more importantly who, is he willing to sacrifice in order to get to the top?(highly requested that I turn my Slytherin Remus headcanons into a proper fic so here it is! big slowburn sorry guys)this work is gifted to @girlwithacrown and @aavx bc they are always my biggest supporters even when I'm crying over writer's block- I LOVE YOU TWO SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR BLESSING MY LIFE W UR PRESENCE

","
After Voldemort killed Lily and James Potter, he also killed the rest of Harry's relatives. Dumbledore had no choice but to raise the boy himself. Harry Potter grew up in fame, as the Boy Who Lived and knew it too. Everyone loved him, and Harry came to Hogwarts as a charming, mysterious, and reserved celebrity. His fame only increased when year after year Harry and his two best friends, Hermione and Ron, defeated all attempts of the Dark Lord's return. After the war, Harry continued to work his celebrity status to pass new legislation, reform conservative laws, and give sentences to Death Eaters. Hermione quickly rose in the ranks of the Ministry, and Ron had his hands full with a new baby. However, everything changes when Harry sees none other than Draco Malfoy at a charity event, now a renowned potion brewer and collector, although his practice is shrouded in mystery. Harry tries to avoid Draco, but when Hermione and Ron mysteriously grow fond of Draco, Harry must learn to forgive and forget or explain himself. The only problem is, Harry and Draco have some unfinished business from their time at Hogwarts--and that's the most mysterious thing of all.

The easiest way to win a war is to kill the enemy commander; Ron had showed him that, and so had the Wizarding War. It’s easier said than done in a foreign dimension like this, but it’s still doable. Now if only Cor and Gilgamesh would both stop hovering, Harry would be delighted.  (The four years between Cor Leonis stumbling out of the Tempering Grounds alive and being named the Immortal only to vanish from the public eye, and his resurfacing at the side of a young man with very Lucis Caelum features.)

“Lumos,” George whispered the spell into the clear, night air. The cold silence nipped at his nose, and his fingers shirked from their duty of holding the heavy box. But, even without pulling his wand out, the spell took hold, lighting up the back ally of Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes. The soft glow emanated from his back pocket, illuminating the purple trash bins and brickwork.He took a moment to consider his aims. Just a quick trip, really. Check on Granger. Maybe make her smile. Drop by a few things he thought she’d like.If she was available, maybe they’d work together on their respective projects for a while. He’d be careful not to infringe. The Weasleys had seen less and less of her recently, and she’d left Ron and Hannah’s wedding reception early last week, claiming a headache.But, George had looked up from his friendly conversation with Katie Bell and spotted her from across the room. Her eyes had been red.That wouldn’t do at all.

Instinct, by definition of the Oxford reference, is a complex pattern of behaviour innately determined, which is characteristic of all individuals of the same species. It is also a natural drive that urges the individual towards a particular goal. Animal instinct. Human instinct. At times, a blend of the two. That is what Hermione relies on as she sprints through the dense Scottish forest and harsh spring rain. On four legs, she outpaces the large, ebony wolf nipping at her tail. Shaggy, honey brown coat drenched and weighed her down, yet she continued to remain out of reach of the alpha. Only just out of reach, but she enjoyed an exhilarating hunt, even if she was to be the prey. Of a sense, mostly. TOMIONE SMUTFEST 2020: A/B/O AU prompt

Much later that evening, with Draco nestled naked between them, Theo looked over at Hermione. Draco was fast asleep, curled with his arms thrown around Hermione and his feet pressed against Theo’s shins. In sleep his worried frown had disappeared and he looked years younger. Hermione was still awake, and she smiled sadly and reached over to take Theo’s hand, resting them on Draco’s side. He murmured in his sleep and snuggled closer to Hermione. ‘I hate seeing him like this,’ Theo admitted, and Hermione squeezed his hand in sympathy. ‘Me too,’ she whispered. ‘I wish there was something we could do to help him.’‘I wish we could just keep him here. The three of us could just hideaway here, ride out the war and stay safe.’ If Theo hadn’t chosen that moment to sigh and fall back onto the pillows, maybe there would have been a clue in Hermione’s eyes as to what she was really thinking. As it was, there was a pause before she replied.‘If only we could bring this stupid war to a quicker end somehow.’

As if Harry didn’t have his hands full already, Draco Malfoy has made a comeback from the dead to torment him. However, this is not the Malfoy he knows, this one apologises to him occasionally, and his blasted tanned skin and gold-streaked hair are unknowingly making Harry want things he shouldn’t want. He’s just trying to do his job.It’s been ten years since Harry defeated Voldemort. He has been promoted to Head Auror a year ago, and now into his arms there has fallen a case of illegal memory potions being sold. If he wasn’t busy enough as it was, somehow Draco Malfoy has managed to tangle his name up in the case, and neither of them seem to get rid of the other, no matter how hard they try.Harry is plagued by the realization that while everyone else’s life moves forward, his doesn’t seem to do so, and there aren’t many people who understand what he’s been through. Unfortunately, that one blond tosser with his sneering manner is managing to slowly make himself feel like an inevitability.

Just your typical Nico di Angelo goes to Hogwarts story, except where it isn't. (I hope) Nico just wanted to live a normal life, or at least as normal as you can get for a son of Hades. He wanted to hang out with his friends and his sister. He wanted to redecorate the Hades cabin because, gods it's ugly. He wanted to spend time with Will Solace and be at peace for once. Having his father and the goddess of magic appear on his doorstep smashes any chance for peace. He still didn't know why he felt like he knew the Percy look-alike though.Harry Potter was ready to go insane. Cut off from the wizarding world and then attacked by dementors. He is beyond confused. First of all he has no idea what Voldemort was up to. Second of all he's been having weird dreams lately and could barely remember them when he woke up. Lastly was the whole deal with the American transfer student. Harry couldn't figure out why he seemed so familiar.Takes place after Heroes of Olympus, during Order of the Phoenix.

“Why, Padfoot?” Remus asked, his voice apologetic. As if he was already aware of what the answer was, as if he regretted the mere thought of asking him to explain. There were doors left locked in Grimmauld Place because of the horrors that lay within. Sirius, a Black to his core, was much the same.“You know why.”“Yes,” came Remus’ sickeningly gentle and reluctant agreement, “but I think it’d still help if you explained.”“Oh,” Sirius laughed a little just under his breath. Even to his own ears, the sound was too hysterical to be of actual amusement. “Because we’re both so well versed. Talking about things, the thing we do best. Fantastic idea, that.”

Percy walks into the Wizengamot and calls for votes against the measure.  He makes a principled, brave stand: Bellatrix Lestrange was barking mad.  Nothing could have prevented her.  She and Morgana and Nimue and Grindelwald do not set a precedent that women and confirmed bachelors and childless people are mad and dangerous.  Children are not some Midas touch of goodness, he says into a ringing silence. 
Three weeks later, Percy drinks a cup of tea in a staff meeting, chokes, and begins to turn to gold.

The long-game personified.--Harry would never have guessed that his animagus would have been a snake. Nor the trouble it would bring when Voldemort found out.

Pansy couldn’t explain how right it felt. The pure certainty that everything in her world seemed to point to him. Her heart beat for the man. She’d descended into a spiral of chaos when he, for the briefest moment, wasn’t hers. His words had seared into her, and his touch—a touch which felt innocent for so long now felt so different, like it was something personal—hers. It made her want nothing more than to give him everything he wanted, and more. To Lucius, her Lucius. Of course. Of course, it was him.-----Smart, stylish, spirited Pansy was the perfect example of what an elegant Pureblooded witch ought to be. With a passion for match-making, she seldom worried about finding love for herself. So why, when Pansy could have any man she wanted, could she not get her dearest friend and closest confidant out of her head?Modern-era story inspired by Jane Austen's  Emma. Written for Fairest of the Rare Spring Fest.

Draco goes back to Hogwarts after the battle as part of his probation and learns a lot about himself and his classmates.It is a story of healing and acceptance with the characters finding their place in the world after the war and thinking about what they want that world to look like. Things will be difficult at first with tension amongst the characters, many of them still suffering the after effects of the war. However slowly, they will start to understand and support each other as existing relationships continue and new ones form. On top of this Harry and Draco (but Draco especially) haven’t really had any experience of relationships and are still trying to work out their sexuality and what they want from life as they are now able to look to the future in a way they never really thought they could.This story is set immediately after the final battle at Hogwarts and will take us through the next year (and a bit!) after the war. The idea is that it could be the next book in the series after DH, however, as a bit of a twist, Draco is the main character, not Harry. It is canon-compliant with all the events of the books but ignores the epilogue and the later events of The Cursed Child. Full summary inside.

This story is not set in the wizarding world, but rather just ordinary life. Draco is tired of his stressful life as the CEO of Malfoy Company. One day he decides to take a closer look at the small bakery that lies between his home and the Company. He finds the peaceful atmosphere to be just what he needed, and it doesn't hurt that the black-haired pastry girl is cute. However, seeing the similar-looking, but manly black-haired guy that also seems to work there, catches Draco's attention. Who is he? Why did Draco have to stare at him? It was just because of the guy being unusually handsome, right?  That was definitely it...  A story of a tired CEO worker, and a carefree bakery owner.

After the war Draco Malfoy is sentenced to Azkaban for a really long sentence. Apparently aiding in Dumbledore's death overrules any argument Harry could put up for him.After the trial, as the days pass by, Harry is more and more outraged at the sentence. He can't stop obsessing over the fact that Draco Malfoy saved his life and aided him during the war and is very much capable of redemption. Not to mention that Malfoy has always been a delicate git and would never survive Azkaban.After a few weeks obsessing Harry decides that Malfoy indeed can't remain unjustly in Azkaban and starts to plot a way to break him out of jail and hide him in Grimmauld Place. When Hermione finds out she's not amused. Ron is horrified. Draco still thinks he's hallucinating.

The two students walked to the far end of the table casually, slipping in next to what looked like Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini. The conversations slowly came back up, softer than it was before, but Harry couldn't focus on anything but the boy.Not only was his hair different, Harry noticed, but his whole wardrobe was too. The pastel boy had ill fitting robes on, and light pink earrings in his ears. When he rolled up his sleeves, the Dark Mark -a mark that Voldemort had given his followers, was gone completely, in its place laid an arrangement of flowers and what looked like writing.""Did you know he was coming back?""

They had to keep it from their friends, their teachers, families. All that pressure sometimes just gets too much.-In which Hermione develops an eating disorder and Draco deals with his own fair share of mental health issues and trauma.

He was ashamed to say that his first thought was that he'd gone a little hard on the drink and had taken a psycho home with him.

Tom Riddle is an enigma to all who meet him. Polite beyond measure, celebrated across factions, and incredibly composed to an almost ridiculous degree. Yet so little is known about what he's like outside of practiced smiles and reserved interactions. Truly, many see him as the epitome of a sort of outward perfection, a figure whose true thoughts are hidden away and unattainable to practically all who try.And then a particular someone is injured, and the facade comes crashing down.

Draco and Neville talked about the ‘Lord of the Rings’ and how far they were up to with occasional commentary from Hermione - the book series was recommended by Harry and they’d already devoured the previously recommended book, ‘The Hobbit’. Harry was enthusiastically telling Susan Bones about “the one time I won an axe-throwing competition” that Hermione kept glancing at him nervously over.Well, the meal was going well until Professor Quirrell burst into the Great Hall, “Troll! Troll in the dungeon! Thought you oughta know…” and fainted right where he stood.AKAHow the Donahue Gang deals with a troll at their Halloween feast

Once upon a time, Harry Potter was killed and Voldemort won the war. Things went from bad to worse, and strangely enough, this was even true for those that had supported Voldemort. Nothing in the world was as it should have been.And then there was a second chance, and things changed. They did not, however, change nicely or easily or even willingly.Note: Originally written and posted to LiveJournal in 2006; doesn't draw on the movies or anything after Half-Blood Prince (and diverges from that book).

""Do you resent me?” James suddenly asks. Remus doesn't avert his gaze from the star-scattered sky. “The number of people that I resent has drastically increased these last years, but you’re not one of them, no.” They stay quiet for a while, until Remus speaks again. “Do you resent yourself?” James runs his hand through his hair. “I don’t know.

When he arrives at the castle, he is confronted by former colleague Neville Longbottom, who is now Herbology professor. Neville insists on proving that Draco is innocent, and he isn't the only one meddling in Greg's investigation.  Mycroft Holmes, who occupies a 'minor position' in the Ministry of Magic, knows more than he he's letting on about what’s lurking at Hogwarts and in what way it threatens everything he cares about.

Written for Hermione's Nook Anniversary Drabble Fest. Prompt: It's five minutes to midnight on NYE, and Person A is looking for Person B to give them their first kiss of the year. Just before midnight, they finally find each other.

A bright, familiar laugh rang out over the din and Remus felt his heart leap in his chest, automatically scanning the crowd for a shock of red hair. Despite his protests to the contrary Remus couldn’t deny the feelings of affection, protectiveness and, yes, lust that Lily Evans stirred in him. That he was a werewolf never seemed to bother her, and he had long considered her his best friend, time spent bonding over books and homework and rolling their eyes at the other Marauder’s antics blossoming into  fancy on his part.
Grabbing up the shot that had been set on the bar for a woman paying less attention to it than her date Remus tossed it back, letting the alcohol instill him with a confidence he rarely felt in everyday life before he pushed into the crowd, intent on finding her. Purpose fuelled his steps, Sirius’s words echoing in his mind as a desperate sort of hope that he was right, Lily felt the same, filled him.

In a world where Hunters are aware of the wizarding world, some distrust those born with magic as much as the witches made from human sacrifice and demon deals, while others take advantage of their gifts, and some see them as allies. Two years ago, Dean was one of the first type, until he met and teamed up with Hermione Granger. Now, with his father missing, he has to balance his relationship with a (good) witch, reestablish his bond with his brother, find his father, and when he does -- keep that father from shooting his girl.

The first time one of them said I love you, they were fourteen. Harry broke off the kiss-- their fifth, the night of the Yule Ball-- and whispered it reverently in Draco’s ear. Draco fake gagged all over Harry, but a few weeks later, shivering from the cold of the lake (“I thought it’d be a toss-up between you or Ron,” Harry’d said), he said it too. Harry pretended he’d just smelled something vile.

A heart rotting curse, if Harry expected to die, it would have certainly been in a painful way. Just perhaps not by one of the worst curses that didn't fit into the unforgivables.Hermione and Ron had at least passed before him, so Harry's not too miffed about dying. He doesn't even mind that their group healer is too magically exhausted to cast the counter curse. It is a complex bit of magic and the healer had been working tirelessly to keep Harry's force of four alive against Voldemort.

Harry was still out there and if Remus could see him, even if it was just once, maybe it would give him the motivation to carry on. But when he arrived at the Dursley's house, he found something that shook him to the core.

Granger. Why did it always have to be Granger who occupied his thoughts?If only she wasn’t a Mudblood. Her being Gryffindor wasn’t a big problem. Her being smart was great, he was secretly really annoyed with how dumb some of the Slytherin girls are. Her being feisty was annoying but he kind of liked the challenge. Her being at the ball with Krum obviously meant that others saw she was desirable too. Her being Mudblood was… Damn. Maybe he was the one with the problem, not her.

She fought in one war, only to be thrust into another. Well... at least the second one seemed easier... Right?Being a half-blood was hell on Earth during Voldemort's war, but she had made it through. She had once had one of the most promising futures as an International Dueling Champion, having already won several trophies and titles. She would even bet that she knew more magic than the Malfoy's. But none of that mattered because her mum was muggleborn. With her parents dead, her home destroyed and no other family, she didn’t have much tying her to Britain anymore.That was lucky since she didn't think she would see Britain again...***Undergoing minor editing but still posting new chapters!***

But I don’t even know if he’s gay, and even if he is, he would probably never like me like that.”“Sirius, I’ve never met a rational person who didn’t like you.” Remus soothed. “I’m sure whoever this guy is, he thinks you’re amazing.” “I’m not sure. The thing is, we’re really good friends, and I’m afraid that I’ll jeopardize that, if I tell him how I feel.” Sirius sighed.  “I’m gonna go up. You coming?”""No, I think I'll stay down here and read."" Remus answered, pulling out the book he had brought with him. ""Night, Pads.""""Night, Moony,""Remus sat there, in front of the fire, reading for what could have been hours. He kept getting distracted, however, by that feeling, those butterflies that had suddenly erupted.

Not when he’s head over heels for someone else.'

The room was dark and cold; several figures wearing black robes stood in a circle around a tall, pale, man, and the giant snake resting in his arms. Their faces were concealed by heavy hoods and their heads were lowered as a gesture of respect. They barely dared to breathe, terrified of missing a single word from their leader's speech.
 “There are many prominent witches and wizards who might join our ranks after the school year ends tomorrow. Watch them when they come home on Saturday and report the results to me,” a cold voice echoed in the silence. They knew that the summer of 1978 would be difficult for them, but they didn't realize how their lives would change once they choose the side. Voldemort is rising and The Order wants to stop him; but will they be able to? The Death Eaters are not going to let them win this war.What will happen to everyone? Will James and Lily survive at the end? Is it possible for Regulus and Sirius to become brothers ever again? Does Snape have a chance for redemption?

Severus Snape was not a good man. He had proved that many years ago. His attempts at redemption had still not been enough for him, and so he was very surprised that someone else had decided that they had certainly been enough for them.

After everything he'd gone through, all Harry wanted was to live a normal life. He didn't want there to be anything extraordinary about him, not one bit. He didn't want to make the papers anymore. He didn't want his name laced into anyone's rumours or gossip. All he wanted was to be at peace for once in his bloody miserable life.When Harry Potter finally finds himself ready to come out, it starts to feel like life is giving him more questions than answers. The last place he expects to find any sort of solace is at Draco Malfoy's doorstep. But something about Malfoy just...feels like all those little missing pieces of himself are coming together in a way he just doesn't think he can ignore.A 30-day Pride-focused Drarry challenge.

“Well, consider me at your service, if you ever need someone to use, say, for exacting a secret revenge on a thoughtless husband.” He smirked, and her jaw may very well have dropped. Had he just offered to cheat on her husband with her?“What? Here and now?” Hermione laughed nervously. The fact that she hadn’t whipped out her wand and cursed him for even making such a suggestion was evidence of how angry she must really be with Ronald, if not of how drunk she must really be. “That’s insane.” At least she could claim insanity later, right? Her heart was pounding now, so much so she thought he must have been able to hear it. She swore she could. She should run. Any decent married woman would. Why, then, did her feet refuse to move?“And that wasn’t a no,” he informed her. They stared at each other with baited breath. Draco took a step towards her, reaching one hand up to draw her towards him.

When Harry Potter went onto the train the second time in his life, he never expected to become Master of Death, which meant he never died but went into Rebirth instead.

Draco Malfoy never asked for a second chance, nor did he particularly want one. But he found himself in his old body at eleven, and after a year at Hogwarts, he has a plan for the year before him: keep to himself, find Dobby, improve relations with fellow Slytherins to cordial but distant, get over this stupid obsession with Harry Potter, and no more jokes about controlling a Malfoy mountain troll. No one else thinks they're funny. And no more cursing people- well, only as many people as necessary...Draco Malfoy has never been very good at following plans.

The Sorting Ceremony was very important. However, students were not always sorted where they wanted. -----------------------------------------------Wei Ying was reckless, proud, and shameless, like his mother. The professors didn't doubt that the Sorting Hat would sort him out in Gryffindor. Cangse Sanren was a Gryffindor, like her husband. She was one of the greatest witch of her generation, a Muggle-born: she never let anyone use her origins against her, hating Malfoy and Black for their cult of blood purity. Her death had shocked everyone. When Jiang Fengmian saw Wei Ying, he hoped that the boy ended up in Gryffindor, so he could control and protect him. The Sorting Hat had a different idea,"" Ravenclaw!""Lan Qiren almost choked on his pumpkin juice.

Can their relationship survive jealous lions, meddlesome snakes, N.E.W.T.S. and a year of Friday night quidditch games?  If Hermione has anything to say about it, they'll come out of the other side stronger than ever.  Hopefully fate agrees.

Harry Potter somewhat reluctantly returns to Hogwarts after the war to finish his schooling. It's more difficult than he imagines to find routine again, faced with the realities of living in the space where so many died and so many things went terribly wrong. With a hefty amount of therapy, a lot of aimless wandering, and a redefining of several relationships, Harry does manage to begin to find a new normal, though that normal is somehow no less complicated than his life was before. 
(Or: Harry needs to figure out who he is without the war and his destiny motivating him, and so does Draco Malfoy. Somehow, they end up doing it together.)

Following a decades long war the Malfoy kingdom must make allies with those they'd tried to eradicate, or face that fate themselves. What seemed impossible somehow was anything but, as in only a handful of months the Malfoy heir was betrothed to his Royal Majesty the King, Harry James Potter. Yet the differences between the Potter and Malfoy kingdoms are stark, and as the two unlikely spouses could tell you, full of all these fucking thorns.

Harry returns to Hogwarts for his eighth year and everything is different. The people, the atmosphere, the studying. He can't seem to catch a break - oh, and he's horny all the freaking time. When Draco and Harry somehow start to act civil around each other, they realize they have similar problems. They have an idea: Let's drink some dangerous love potion to feel attracted to each other and fuck their brains out to release some pressure. What could go wrong? Nothing, right? Only that Harry slowly, very slowly, begins to realize that maybe he doesn't need a love potion to fall in love with Draco.

Rage: violent uncontrollable anger.Harry was angry. Angry at the old coot for keeping that from him. Angry at his supposed friends stealing from him. Angry that he is placed with those muggles again. His anger was burning him from the inside out and normally he squashed it but not this time. This time, he accepted it, welcomed it. Made it a cup of tea, added biscuits and offered his best chairs. Told it to make itself at home. He also told his welcome visitor, to stay as long as they want. Anger gave a wicked grin. Oh, he was staying for a long time. Labelled as mature - just the themes. I'm sorry if this triggers anyone, I don't mean to. So far, there is abuse. Most likely add more themes in later e.g gore and stuff. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter and co. Just the plot! They belong to the awesome J.K Rowling

Prompted by @justdyingontheinside on Tumblr: Harry is a photographer and he always takes photos of Draco

“Enough,” Draco said, briefly shutting his eyes. Seven years and he was still as pathetic. He started gathering his belongings. “Excuse me, I have to leave.”


“I haven’t even started.”


“There is nothing for us to talk about.”


“There’s plenty, actually.”


Draco pushed himself out of the booth. “Oh, shut your—”


A warm hand grabbed his wrist. Draco, shocked into silence, stopped. Harry tightened his grasp, firm enough to keep Draco from leaving but gentle enough not to hurt.


“Draco.” He swallowed. “Stay.”

Harry Potter has returned from his seven-year world tour and is back in London, with a photography exhibition. Draco is not prepared.

It's Tom Riddle's fifth year at Hogwarts, and between trying to balance his classes, staying as far away from Dumbledore as possible, and gathering followers in hopes of taking over the Ministry in the future, he does not need the mysterious snake-like flowers appearing on his pillow every morning. He also really doesn't need the Head Boy, Dorian Beaufils, showing up wherever he is, because honestly, it's quite annoying. And what's even more angering, is that it's also quite endearing. No matter that Beaufils' eyes are so eerily similar to those of the monster residing in the Chamber.

Right on queue, Sirius burst through the large doors of the great hall, Harry on his arms, walking towards the teachers table.All eyes were on him and of course he used that to his advantage (as if him being late wasn't planned in the first place).“Oh darling, you're already here I thought we agreed on walking here together, I looked all over for you.” He yelled across the whole hall over to Remus, who just rolled his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation. Harry giggled in Sirius' arms, playing with his hair that hung loosely over his shoulder.or Sirius and Remus are Professors at Hogwarts and run into a little bit of a problem when Molly can't take care of Harry for the day.

Lily Evans was many things. She was a witch first and foremost, and currently – though not for very much longer – in her 5th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was a proud Gryffindor. She was muggleborn, the first witch in her family. She was a talented potion maker, often spending her free time down in the dungeons mixing her brews and revelling in the multicoloured fumes. She was a dab hand at her charm work and liked to summon little sparkling lights to brighten up her study spaces. She was a passionate friend. She was bright, loved nothing more than spending her afternoons listening to records in the sun, and adored being outdoors surrounded by nature. Yes, Lily Evans was many things.But at that precise moment, on a sunny afternoon in June after having just sat her Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L, she was absolutely fucking furious.|| Or, what happened after that incident at the lake.

Hufflepuff, to everyone’s surprise, is rumored to be a top contender to win the inter-house Quidditch Cup. Returning for her eighth year, Hermione is recruited by Ginny and the Gryffindor house team to spy on Hufflepuff’s Quidditch practices in order for them to gain insider information. The only problem is that Hermione knows little about the sport of Quidditch. Disguising herself as a Hufflepuff student, she has an accidental run-in with Draco. He attempts to befriend her Hufflepuff persona, Robbie Fenwick. Leveraging a friendship with Draco, she asks him to help her learn the sport so she can be of use to her house team. Draco and Robbie become friends, but what starts as intrigue for Hermione turns into feelings for him.

This is the Deathly Hallows continuation of my last fic, ""For enemies."" It builds on the Drarry interactions in JKR's plot and then some. Nothing is too inconsistent in terms of the unfolding events, but there are definitely twists. This one has less explicit smut (only a couple of scenes towards the end) but more angst, feelings, tension, and buildup. Also, Draco is, like, capital G Good and definitely more helpful than is probably realistic at this stage in his life.

Lupus Wysteria Malfoy was not your average Malfoy female. Sure, she enjoyed wearing dresses, attending dinner parties, and spending time with her family, but there was one major difference. 
She cared deeply about those her family rejected. They interested her and she did not believe they were beneath her. She wasn't more deserving of magic than they were and she certainly wasn't better than them in any manner. Except perhaps at studying, but that wasn't what the phrase ""better than them"" meant in this situation.
Her feelings grow and grow and soon she realizes she cannot live as her family does anymore.
However, change is not accepted in the Malfoy house and this puts her on the brink of danger.
No side will accept her, leaving her alone. Will she be able to find help, or will she finally be broken?
This is her story.

~“Thank you.” Remus ran a hand through his soaked curls. “Sirius, I-” Come on, Lupin. “I-” Remus walked in, past Sirius, and shut the door. “Sirius, I- Can I kiss you? I’ve wanted to kiss you again for an eternity.”Sirius stuttered a little, and dragged a hand over his face. “Remus?! What-” he put his hands on his hips, his cheeks a little flustered. “What?!”“Oh my fucking God. I ruined it.”~Remus Lupin is a 27 year old junior-associate at lawfirm Slughorn & Fortescue. For three years, his hard work and dedication have gone unnoticed. He lives in a shabby flat, with mountains of student loans, and has already accepted his fate of being stuck in his little cubicle forever when senior partner, and court-room legend, Kingsley Shacklebolt calls him up to his office. Remus then meets Sirius Black, the embodiment of beautify and grace, and from that moment on his life changes. He gets to work with the big-shots, and prove his worth as a lawyer. Although... However his plea against work-place relationships and too handsome men may be, he can't help but fall for his boss' secretary.

Harry lost everything and everyone,the final battle was disastrous . Many were dead and he wished only have a normal life, just be the son of a Marauder. He wished he weren't the BWL. It is impossible to change the past,but there is a detail that young Potter doesn't know. When he was a baby his magic core was divided into two bodies,yours and yours in another dimension.Harry end up in a dimension where his parents are alive and the second wizarding war never happened, but does that mean the world is at peace? Not everything is as it seems.

The fallen Slytherin wasn't acting from a place of altruism, though, and Hermione knows it. He wants something from her, but she can't guess what it might be or the depths of his obsession with her until he makes himself available for use by the Second Order of the Phoenix.

Doesn’t he know that he can literally just write his name - and nothing but his name - on any application for anything and it will be accepted?” Shacklebolt held up the said application that was there for his review, courtesy of Podmore, who’d vetted out the useless ones. “But he really went and wrote about the time he blew up his aunt for ‘When has the Committee acted in your life?

Harry was just a 7 year old boy trying to get some sleep before having to do chores. But life is never normal if you're Harry James Potter. Read as Harry talks to Death, gets removed from the Dursleys and put into Grimmauld Place with everyone's favourite godparents, Padfoot and Moony. Hold up, how did he talk to Death!? You better read to find out! Voldemort is 100% dead in this book, but Dumbledore doesn't believe it.

And not just in that way.

Magic was a complicated and wonderful thing. On several occasions it has been known to not only bend the rules of physics but outright break them, and in more dubious cases it had even gone head to head with the laws of nature as well. On one such night a certain Lily Potter fervently claims that it had rained indoors. This response, however, was only solicited upon asking Mrs. Potter a specific set of questions on what exactly took place on her front porch, February 23rd 1979, after a group of friends met at the Potter home for pleasant conversation and drink. Other responses include: “None of your business,” “Don’t you have work to be doing,” and “So help me, James, if you don’t go away!”

One day, a young girl sits on the edge of a well. On this day, she falls in. Then the next, she’s not even a ‘she’ anymore. He’s Peter Pettigrew — doomed to die at the hands of his (betrayed) friend’s son.Peter is selfish, bitter and brash. He’s not some fairy tale hero, he doesn’t care if everyone around him dies, as long as he lives. The marauders are annoying and childish. Survival is his priority, and he can’t afford to face distractions. This just makes the fact that soulmates are now apparently a thing all the more godawful.(And then another day years later he falls into an entirely new impossibility, Remus Lupin in tow, right into the third book of Harry Potter. Smack bang on the other Peter Pettigrew’s grave).It’s confusing and graceless, and entirely something that would happen to him of all people.—update schedule: have not forgotten, just <3 depressed <3working on the new chapter now

Malfoy turned from her now to her sister. Petunia’s eyes were glazed, streaming unending tears, and her mouth slack. It was as if she had been transported back to girlhood. Gone were the hard lines of her face. Like curtains parting, Lily saw her sister as she once was: wide eyed, curious, and innocent; before Hogwarts, before magic.
  “Now, what shall we do with you, my dear? Shall we show Lily darling what happens when people like her take what isn’t theirs?” His voice was soft and persuasive. He spoke as if to a close confidant. Withdrawing his wand from his robe sleeve, he turned it on Petunia. “What do you think, Miss Evans? Shall we have a quick show and tell?” || When Death Eaters attack her family, Lily must try to protect them at all costs. If only it was that easy. But at least James Potter is there to pick up the pieces.

Harry has been through a lot during his first year. Dumbledore is well aware of that. What he did not know was about the dreams Harry had been having. Dreams of the first year of his life before a once happy family was broken. These dreams of the past, along with protective friends and family are what change Harry's path, giving him and his friends the chance to do more than they thought they could. Dumbledore has to rethink his plans for the Boy-Who-Lived, after the people who care enough to see the truth set his priorities straight. Harry is given a new home, a new chance, and above all a new life that he chooses to base on what he learns of his past from his dreams. This includes rebuilding the Marauders legacy in a new way and preparing for what's to come. It's not like he's oblivious to the fact Voldemort will keep coming after him, right?

 “'Some speak of a ring,’” Mr. Weasley began, “‘that lies nestled on a dark, crumbling twig in a clearing in the woods. The woods are dark, unforgiving, and many are warned against going within the trees―some might even say it's forbidden,’” He winked at Harry then, who couldn’t help but roll his eyes. 
“So, it’s a fairy tale about the Forbidden Forest.” 
“Yes, I suppose so,” Said Mr. Weasley, and straightened with a slight wince to tell him firmly, “and I know you’ve got a history of tromping around in there, so I’m telling you now,  do not go back in there to look for rings. Bad idea.” 
Stories are just stories—nothing more, nothing less. Morals and lessons can be gleaned by parables and fables alike, but the truth of it is so. That’s what people believe, at least. And that’s exactly what makes them so dangerous.There's a grain of truth in every tale. Harry learns this the hard way when a fairy tale Arthur tells him comes to life, and he’s forced to abandon the wizarding world at the worst possible time—by winding up stuck in 1942 for six months. 
Believe it or not, being Tom Riddle's unwitting roommate isn't even the worst part of it.

[Excerpt:] Eleven schools struck me as very little and homeschooling is all well and good, but where does that leave the muggleborns? Would they constantly break the statute of secrecy because their magic is through no fault of their own untrained? How many muggleborns are there anyways? For that matter, how many witches and wizards are there? I set out to discover the answers to these questions, through math and logic and the liberal application of google to the problem. Allow me to take you along on this journey, on which I discovered what I like to call: The Trouble With JKR’s Math.

Presumed dead from the moment she was born, Katrina Potter has led a sheltered life, hidden away from the wizarding world for her own safety. Upon Voldemort's return, she is thrust back into the world that for years, she was forced to learn about from her books and through staring out her bedroom window. With so many questions swirling around her supposed return from the dead, she finds herself under an even harsher spotlight than her brother, a constant subject of scrutiny by the Ministry and her peers. Under threat of an impending war, Katrina adjusts to her new reality, while protecting her brother from those who mock him, including a certain blonde Slytherin, and his own stubbornness, and unbeknownst to them, she could be the key to tipping the war in favor of the light or the dark.

Dumbledore seems to be controlling the strings, and harry's friends seem different.First fic so constructive criticism is welcome but please tell me what to improve not just that there are errors in the fic/chapter.

Inside, Hermione bypassed the wooden desk at the front completely and led me toward the back of the small shop. The walls held framed prints of tattoos, some still and some clearly magical. My eyes fixed on an inked serpent peering up between two scandalously naked breasts, tongue flickering out intermittently. “Are you sure we’re supposed to just walk right in?” Was artwork like this even allowed on Diagon Alley? This felt more like Knockturn.“Yes, they’re expecting us.” She paused outside the door. “Now, listen. I’d like you to keep an open mind about the tattoo artist and not react…hastily.”“Oi, bring him in already!” The unmistakable voice of Ron Weasley cut through the door.Hermione intertwined her fingers with mine before I could escape.

Hey everyone. As the title says, this is an alternative ending for Norische's brilliant story; Follow MeThis is just a nice wrap up after the events of the 'last chapter' of that story. I know I may have skipped a thing or two, since it would probably take me a few chapters to adress everything properly, but I do hope you still like the way it turned out. Also, we have different writings, so you may notice a thing or two that are not as in the main story, but please understand.

Surely, any wizard who knows pureblood circles, knows you’re nothing to someone unless you can name their second cousin three times removed, as well as know exactly who in their family not to mention at dinner. Who was this Dark Lord’s second cousin three times removed? And why was he clearly not mentioning any of his family at dinner?Regulus realises he might have found a way to make the idea of his joining the Dark Lord as repugnant to his fanatical pureblood mother as it is to him. Unfortunately, especially when it comes to avoiding a war, we often meet our fate on the road we take to avoid it.

Voldemort was one of the most famous and earliest artists from the Renaissance Era and arguably the most famous English one. He painted, sculpted countless statues for the public, royalty, and nobles alike.His most famous painting wasn’t a commission nor a piece that he had planned to make money off. It went under the name “The Potterer”, presumably the last painting (and the best work) of Voldemort. Tom Riddle, Voldemort’s last living descendant was given the responsibility to take care of the expensive paintings.AndHarry Potter… Well, Harry didn’t know why everyone kept mistaking him for the person in the painting. What was so special about it anyway? It was just a portrait of someone!

In a universe where the Ministry of Magic controls more about you, than you control about yourself. The Ministry of Magic assigns you a spouse and you're stuck with them whether you like it or not.Sirius Black openly hated Severus Snape and was not shy about the fact that he loved his best friend. When Sirius Black is presented with a marriage summons he cannot ignore, he finds out the true definition of sleeping with the enemy. 
“can seven years of good memories make up for the seven years of bad ones?” “We didn’t get married because we wanted to,” Snape says, “We got married because we had to,” Snape says. “You can have your boy apologize to my son,” Snape says firmly. Sirius watches Snape for a moment, trying not to grin, as he figures out what Snape was really saying, “Tell me,” Sirius says, sitting down on Snape’s lap. “I know,” Snape says looking back at Sirius, “but your side is outnumbered.” Leaving the thin wizard on the ground unmasked, bleeding. “I would die for our child, if it came down to it,” Snape says firmly. There was no way in hell that Sirius had just admitted to giving him a love potion.

‘Why,’ Hermione wanted to ask, after every use of her first name, and when his heated gaze lingered on her. There was nothing that she could give him aside from caring for his son, though he never treated her as a mere governess. The times that she spent with Draco, regardless of whether Tom was between them, or not were her favorite, regardless of the impossible dreams they encouraged. She knew without a doubt that she wanted to stay, though she knew that she could not if Draco took another as his mate. There were letters in her desk left unsealed and unsent, ones she intended for the Longbottoms and other neighboring families, like the Parkinson’s. All had children that she could care for, and she knew that she could work anywhere with Draco’s recommendation. The thought made her heart desperately ache, as everything within her demanded that she stay. Tom lay asleep still in her lap, reminding her of who she would abandon if she sought another position. Still...she longed to stay.Historical Werewolf AU | A certain governess and her employer pine for one another
