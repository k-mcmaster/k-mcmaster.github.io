It was difficult being the boyfriend of The Boy Who Lived, especially when you have a past like Draco's. Between the mounting pressure of his work as a healer, harassment from the press, and increasing jealousy of the friendship Harry had with his school girlfriend, Ginny Weasley, Draco blew up and walked out of Harry's life. But both he and Harry found themselves seeking bad habits, the need for each others comforts. Except, they were both too proud to say it, instead wallowing in self-pity until an accident forces them to talk.
Inspired by 'Bad Habit' from Ben Platt's debut LP 'Sing To Me Instead'.

Living in Grimmauld place with Teddy was perfect.  Or at least it was until Teddy started dating their friend Susan, leaving James feeling left out.  A night out and a sick child, James meets during his first placement of his healer training, changes things though. Just not in any way he could have imagined.

Wanting to figure out what she is she performs a spell with unforeseen consequences. Ruing the sister she did not know about's first kiss by falling out of the sky was an odd way to meet.

The first few months of first year are weird for Sirius in many ways. Like a learning curve that everyone else seemed to have passed years before he even got to it. With the help of his new found friends, he learnt what words were considered 'wrong', that blood status doesn't define who you are (he knew that before, distantly, but it’s been good to get clarity), how most families had vastly different attitudes towards their children than his family does and, most importantly, what a real friendship really is.Sirius isn't from the same families as the other marauders, watch as he tries to wrap his head around what normal is for the others and why he never got the same in his childhood.

From Harry, to her aunt, to her grandfathers, to the one and only woman who could really reassure her.Little Minerva will be more than alright though.[From the fic: She was filled with so many emotions, she did not know how to cope with the whole lot of them. Anxiety, excitement, happiness, nervousness, she could name them all. The knot in her stomach tightened. She had felt like this for the past few days. She was expecting it to arrive, she knew she would eventually get it, but she couldn’t help but feel this way. Today was her eleventh birthday, a pivotal age in the wizarding world, and her entire, weird, but most loving family was going to come at their house to celebrate for lunch, but her granddads and Teddy would probably come over for breakfast, as they had done every year. ]

Ten years after the war Draco Malfoy is living in obscurity, cut off from most of wizard society and working as a potioner for a healer in London. When he finds himself making mistakes, watching spells fail from his wand, he learns he's suffering from a rare wizard illness that is slowly sapping his magic and will eventually leave him a muggle. Sinking into a depression he discovers a new potion in development that boosts magic along with energy and mood. As his addiction to the potion takes hold he realizes he must start selling it to keep his supply steady.
Hermione Granger works for the Ministry in the department of Unlawful Magic. When rumors start about a drug called Viper's Fang hitting the streets she goes undercover to meet with the center of the supply: The Asp.
Things don't go quite as planned when she discovers The Asp isn't an underground druglord, but her old nemesis, suffering and broken as his magic fades away.

About to enter his senior year as a business major in college, Tom Riddle is placed in a prestigious internship. But his hopes for entering the business world successfully seem thwarted when he realizes that his supervisor, Hermione Granger, is the woman from his hometown whom he obsessed over as a teenager. Written for the Tomione Smut Fest 2020, CEO/assistant prompt.“You must be Tom!” Hermione - his supervisor for the next ten weeks - was far too enthusiastic for 8am on a Monday.  Suppressing a grimace and pasting a smile on his face instead, Tom replied “Yes, I am. Are you Hermione?” The question was mostly for show - he already knew the answer - and when she replied in the affirmative he held out his hand for her to shake. Hermione had a firm handshake. Not surprising, but it did nothing to help his unreasonable attraction to her. They locked eyes for just a second beyond the realm of typical social interaction, and then she looked away. Tom thought he saw the faintest of blushes on her cheeks   Well. He knew what he looked like, and while he might be pleasantly surprised that she was attracted to him, mutual attraction was always dangerous.

Zin, after Hermione's wise counsel, has decided that a change in leadership is well overdue. Satan is unimpressed. Beelzebub is just trying not to laugh and shake the camera.

A tender romantic comedy/coming-of-age tale in which Hermione Granger is trying to savor her last summer at camp, thank you very much, but Charlie Weasley keeps disrupting her plans by doing sweaty shirtless push-ups on the lawn. “H.” Charlie cast her a sly, sideways glance through the amber gradient of his aviators. “Want to see how Old Blue shifts?”Hermione didn’t care how Charlie’s truck shifted and Charlie knew it, but she laid her clammy hand over his anyway. A recklessness was unfurling in some dark pit of her heart. *1988 American Muggle Summer Camp Counselor AU, written as part of Rare Pair Spring Fling 2020*

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizadry, like any other modern school, has an all inclusive curriculum. Explained in this innuendo laden story is how it is related to why certain Gryffindors can't sleep. And how across three generations, everyone fails at adulting.OrEveryone has midnight realisations, but the Gryffindors have been having them at exactly 2.15am for years. The realisations are all different but the reason is the same.

It was all Rose's idea, really. ""Try a different style, to get his attention. You never know, something might happen."", also suggesting it as a way to finally find his aesthetic. She was both right and wrong. Month one and two consisted of goth and hippie, but they were only able to get Scorpius flustered, sporting a very impressive blush. Nothing more happened.""Third time's the charm"", or so they say. Albus would have to think of something that made him resemble a sex god if he wanted Scorpius to notice him as something more than a friend.

They sped up and the warm wind really began to move through the car, picking up Millie’s hair and swirling it around her face. “Aack!” she gave a little cry of dismay as she tried to rein it in, twisting it down to the side and holding it there.Oliver glanced at her. “Your hair is a real, true black,” he said. “No brown at all. It’s almost blue in the sun.”Millie’s mouth dropped open in surprise. He had noticed her hair? Enough to note the specifics of the color? Her mind was reeling, but all her mouth could say was, “Yeah. It’s really dark.”“Yeah.” He looked at the road again, squinting against the brightness of the midday sun. “It’s really beautiful.”

Sometimes a single decision can change your whole history. Sometimes a simple question and a little bit of insistence can make all the difference. Sometimes all you need is someone who thinks you deserve a second chance. Draco nearly crumbles under the weight of the Dark Mark and the task he has been given. It’s like a constant weight on his shoulders that just would not let him breathe, would not budge, no matter how hard he tries. But there is another constant during his horrendous sixth year at Hogwarts, always around a corner, always watching: Potter. And Potter seems hellbent on saving him.

Ifalna knew she only had the one child, the single precious seed of life within her. When she felt the Planet gift her with another, she knew it was for a great task, possibly the Greatest. So she vowed to protect them, and teach them as best she could with the time she had left to her.Aerith knew her little brother was a bit different, but it didn't matter, not to her. He held her hand when she was lonely, and told her stories at bedtime, and scared the scientists away when Momma was too tired for their testing. It was them against the world for as long as she could remember. She never expected that their great duty would be to save it in the end. For Terra Gainsborough, having a loving mother and a sister made saving the world, again, worth the price of being reincarnated.

Third, he kept the Dark Lord’s secrets; he remembers the day they came into his home, the Dark Lord and his cult of followers, each crueler and more heartless than the last, and Draco had been fifteen and terrified, and he didn’t feel like a man, not at all, he’d felt like a child. He’d heard the things they planned, seen the things they did, and he’d kept his mouth shut. He thinks he’d died a little, then; the first time he’d heard someone scream under a Crucio was the first time he realized he knew nothing at all, that the glory and the knowledge he thought were his, what he thought the cause he was fighting for entailed, was all wrong.

Loki, Harry and Merlin have a habit of dying only to reawaken without their previous scars, bruises, or injuries. The soulmate triad dies in battle, once again, in the 21st century  AD on Sunday, May-03-2020. Moments later, King Thor and his soulmate Bruce Banner decide to try their first attempt at Magic™. They intend on saving the Universe from Ragnarök by recreating a time-travel ritual Queen Frigga mentioned to Thor in passing moments before her death. Unsurprisingly the two horribly botch it up. To be precise it's now; June 23, 425 in the 5th century AD. Once again they're living on Midgard's continent of Avalon during the Middle Ages. Well… Well, they haven't lived this long without learning to adapt. Besides, it would be 'beyond stupid' and 'completely irresponsible' not to mention 'unbearably boring' to repeat the actions that led to Ragnarök the first time around. Wouldn't it?

Even up to his death, Severus couldn’t be sure why he did it. Lupin had always been a nice enough fellow, and he did make it a point to call Severus by his real name...but he never tried to get the other boys to stop bullying him. Perhaps it was that bottled up rage and the fact that they were alone that made him do it. Or maybe in his pissed up state, he thought he was facing Potter or Black.This fic will take a dive into why Sirius told Snape how to get to the Shrieking Shack, including some discussion on how/why Snape developed the sectumsempra curse and his first use of it.Title from the song of the same name by Oasis.

Ten months ago, Draco had found none other than Harry Potter blindly drunk and bleeding outside a Muggle pub. He'd brought him home and hasn't left his side ever since. He looked after him, took care of him when yet another nightmare plagued him. 
Harry is sure that Draco will leave him at some point, and he can’t let it happen. He can’t have another person leaving his life unexpectedly. So, Harry forces him to leave — after they spend one last night together.

How exactly did Draco Malfoy end up as a suspect in an Auror Office's case after a year of being presumed dead? Well, you'd have to ask Ron Weasley about it - after all, his intuition is supposedly never wrong. But it's clearly not his fault that the only way to place a homeless person, with a propensity for vanishing, under house arrest, is to find them a place to live. And it was Shacklebolt who came up with the idea that Harry Potter will have to look after said person, so you really cannot blame Ron for this one. Anyway, whatever happened in that apartment, Ron had nothing to do with it - he didn't trust Malfoy from the start, so the fact that Harry was (once again) not speaking to him, because he ""ruined his life"" was definitely an overreaction.[AKA: What happens when you force the Chosen One to stay on home office looking after his clearly mentally unstable arch enemy and how do you even deal with being asked questions you really don't know the answears to.]**Note: I'm taking a hiatus from this story for some time (don't know how long though) - don't worry, I WILL come back to it!**

In the eyes of all those involved in the Xiaolin-Heylin conflict Jack Spicer is weak, pathetic, prone to switching sides at the drop of a hat, and thoroughly unable to defend himself without the use of his machines. And that’s just the way he likes it. It’s a kind of comfortable mediocrity he’s worked hard to cultivate over two years, and it may not be perfect, but it's his.His family, for all their dedication to tradition and high expectations, mostly leave him to his own devices so long as he continues to churn out academic achievements and not make too much of a fuss in high society without their say so. So for two years he keeps a tight lid on his other responsibilities, and enjoys the -relatively- stress-free global scavenger hunt against people he quietly considers his friends.And, despite the risks, he manages to keep it all a secret. Jack Spicer gets to keep his slice of average, expectation-less life, and they get a kid that represents more comic relief than an actual threat. Life is good. Things are nice. And then everything gets shot to hell by the start of the Second British Wizarding Civil War.

His fantasy was sweet, gentle, almost child-like—innocent. He did not need to cry or whine for attention, he had it. A strong tender man would take care of him, adore him, shower him with the affection and love he had been denied his entire life. He had always liked the idea of having someone to care for him, of being able to rely on someone completely. He wanted to go into a more innocent mindset and feel safe, knowing that he had someone else to make his decisions. Sometimes there were too many choices to be made each day, and they exhausted Harry.

After the horror of the Great War, ten people were chosen for an experiment: a gene enhancement of humans, to make them immortal and able to control certain elements: light, earth, fire, water, and many more. The Guardians, or so the project was called. The reason they were created was to protect and maintain peace in this vulnerable world.
But humans' greed and power lust took over the real purpose of the experiment once it succeeded; World War II happened. For the greater good, the Guardians scattered around the world. Burying their powers deep within until it was forgotten. The world had been at peace ever since.
It was 2015. A man named Gellert Grindelwald had an ambition to find all the Guardians, and trigger their powers, so they would emerge for a great cause.
Would they fulfill his call?

Didn’t dare try to cross the thin line between friendship and something else.They had eventually crossed it, and in many ways the war had been simpler than what had then unfolded.

“that was really good,” Remus murmured as we curled up in his bed, the full moon still hung in the sky, glowing brightly, we had closed all of the curtains in the room to block it out, and were instead lying under the canopy of his bed, covered by the fabric of his various blankets. “feeling better?” I asked slowly, carefully arranging the blanket to cover both of our bodies beneath it, “so much better,” he mumbled, dropping a kiss to my forehead, “thank you for coming over again, you know I don’t expect you to,” I sighed, rolling onto my side to face him, placing a hand delicately on the scars that littered his bare chest, “I want to be here for you, I don’t care what that means, I want to be here,” he smiled weakly, clearly exhausted. “sleep Remus, you need to regain your strength,” he shrugged me off – just like he did every time, “you need to sleep too, it’s not good for you to keep coming over to tend to me after every full moon, it has just as much effect on you as me,” I rolled my eyes, he used this excuse every time, and I knew it was to try and avoid the truth of the matter.

The battle of Hogwarts had started ahead of schedule, and it had taken all of our combined efforts to get as many of the younger students to safety as time would allow before the castle was crawling with deatheaters. Having secured the last of the younger students in the Hufflepuff and Slytherin common rooms, I raced through the castle, skipping multiple sets of steps as I ran back towards the main hall, slowing to a walk, keeping my wand firmly in my hand, I spotted Blaise Zabini comforting a Hufflepuff girl, who was his not so secret girlfriend. That boy really wasn’t as subtle as he’d like to think he was. Approaching them, I quickly caught their attention, “you two need to get to safety,” they looked at me in shock, “we need to fight,” the girl murmured, I shook my head instantly, “we’ve got enough people, and we don’t need more casualties, get out while you still can,” Blaise looked down at me in shock.

Avalon is a place of dreams and stories: a land of of faerie queens and knights and ladies, a land of magic, outside of time, where everyone is free to do as they will, and the worthy never die. But the thing is, Avalon isn't real. It never was.To accept that there is no island of knights and faerie queens, and that magic is hardly mystical, is part of growing up.To believe that you can reach it is madness, impossible.But Tom Riddle and Bellatrix Black have never had much respect for the concept of impossibility (or sanity).This is the dream of the Knights of Walpurgis: to build a New Avalon, a Dark Utopia, a paradise of magic and freedom and wonder — a post-capitalist anarchy where all beings are equals in the eyes of the law, its leaders devoted to their people and ideals, and followed freely, by choice.A journey to Avalon is never easy — the way is lost in mist: it's easy to go astray.But then, it's just as easy to stumble back onto the path as it is to stumble off of it, and if you're noble and worthy — and above all, lucky — the gods will send a guide to help you find it again. They probably won't tell the guide, though. Gods can be arseholes like that.

Albus' favorite color was silver, no questions asked, no second thoughts.It wasn't because he wanted to show house pride. It wasn't because he was a Slytherin. No. It was because he loved silver, the exact shade of silver that was contained in Scorpius' eyes.Scorpius' favorite color was green, but not just green, emerald green, and a deep shade of it.He loved that deep, dark shade of green because it was the exact color of Albus' eyes. Just one shade darker than his father's, but so deep in comparison, like they had layers upon layers of immense pigment.EXCERPT:“Albus, what’s your favorite color?” Rose asked. ""I just want to know what I should get you for your birthday."" “It’s silver,” Albus said, ""but just get me candy for my birthday."" “Such a Slytherin,” Rose teased. “Showing house pride.” “Yeah.” Albus sighed, looking over at his beautiful (secret)  boyfriend. Scorpius was wearing sunglasses, but if he weren’t his bright silver eyes would’ve been glinting in the sunlight. “House pride.”

Evan's not expecting to run into anyone he knows. Why would he? It's a little Mudblood street in a tiny Mudblood town, and the only reason he's even here is to collect his Mudblood and take him back to the Wizarding World where he belongs. Otherwise, he wouldn't be caught dead anywhere near Spinner's End. One would be hard pressed to find him even thinking of Cokeworth with anything but disdain, normally. Alas, however, because unfortunately for Pureblood, elitist Evan Rosier, he, whilst on his way to procure Severus Snape—Halfblood, damned brilliant and the only Mudblood Evan could stomach being this friendly with—runs into Lily Evans. The Saintly Muggleborn, the Bright One, the Exalted Poster Witch for the Light herself. Well, this won't do at all.Or: Lily Evans misses her best friend. What better way to start mending fences than to invite him to her wedding? Evan Rosier explains why this is an awful idea, (although, admittedly, he is quite biased).

Draco Malfoy stands before him, holding a large paper bag that says 'G U C C I'. She's basking in the pale rays of the morning sun, her straight and what looked to be utterly lustrous hair (which is blond, almost white, and pretty—really pretty) billows, framing her dainty face. She's been sporting an old-school straight fringe, like some Hollywood actress. But unlike one, it doesn't make her look soft or delicate. It makes her look formidable. [An AU in which Draco Malfoy has been in love with Harry Potter all her life. Too bad Harry doesn't share the sentiment. But when she backs off, will he finally have the courage to step forward?]

It's the Tetrawizard Tournament, but Ed is actually more interested in the Hogwarts library. Those pesky tasks are just getting in the way of his research. Also a Yule Ball. Who came up with this again? Anyway, between the Tournament, NEWT preparations (because not even a champion is exempt from those), his research into a cure for Al and his giant if inconvenient crush on one Roy Mustang, their unfairly hot and competent trip supervisor, his year has a bit more excitement than he signed up for. Oh and apparently this Tournament is a giant murder plot, as if he didn't have enough on his plate already.

Being Fleur’s maid of honour was harder than I could have anticipated. My feet finally touched the floor having apparated to the burrow, and I walked to the door, knocking on it quickly, while surveying the scenery. The door opened a moment later, and I turned to face a man I had never met before, “I'm going to assume you are one of the bridesmaids,” he commented leisurely, “that’s right, I'm going to assume you are Charlie Weasley – I don’t believe we’ve met before,” he glanced at me in shock, “correct,” he murmured, stepping aside to allow me to enter. “it’s nice to meet you Charlie,” I offered a quick smile, before searching the downstairs for any hint of where Fleur was, “they are in the kitchen,” he explained, I nodded, allowing him to lead the way to the kitchen.

When small-time singer, Hermione Granger, returns to her hometown to escape a scandal, she reconnects with her troubled past and ends up stirring a chaotic maelstrom that ends with a string of horrific deaths. It boils down to enthusiastic policeman, Harry Potter, and a mild school counselor, Remus Lupin, to solve the murders with the help of the double-edged sword known as information technology.Disclaimer: Some characters have been aged up, some aged down. Backgrounds, family structures, are changed. Other OCs have been added.Note: This is actually an original novel that I posted on Tapas. I was curious to see how it would be received as a fanfic, so I converted some of my OCs to Harry Potter characters.

Draco's life has been one big mess ever since Potter broke up with him. He doesn't want to see his friends, he's too ashamed to see his parents, and his apartment is one giant mess.

Ron nods once. “I kept thinking what if I trip and fall?“ he chuckles at the memory.

OR: Draco is whipped for Harry and can't keep his hands to himself — Harry doesn't want him to, anyways.

The owner of this flower shop is none other than the soft blonde haired Draco Malfoy.If only he knew it were that easy when you fell in love... Will Harry visit Draco enough times to be told about the blonde’s favourite flower? And just enough times to not be head over heels for him? (Hint : the second answer is absolutely not.)

They’re barely nine when it really strikes Fred for the first time that they look remarkably similar. “Say, Georgie — what’s it like being so handsome?” George looks up from the broom he’s trying to glare into submission, and his face scrunches up for a second, staring at Fred with obvious confusion. Then it evens out, splitting into a smile that pulls higher towards his right ear than his left. “Well, I don’t know, Freddie; why don’t you tell me?”

There is a path that all must travel down in life. The dirt road carries on through the countryside until it reaches a fork, where one must choose between a murky path that twists and bends deeper into the undergrowth of the forest, and a straightforward path to a grassy meadow under the sun. Both are equally as trodden as the other. No past traveler can say for sure which is better. Everyone must choose, and the one you choose will make all the difference. Beware child, it is not wicked to wander around in the dark, but do be careful, for it is a treacherous path built to be explored alone. So many have perished in the pursuit of the unknown. Keep sight of what is true for even the purest of hearts can lose their way.

Cheating/Adultery/Affair/DramaRon Weasley's life has been good since the war. Tough, unreasonably hard but good. He had an amazingly smart wife, a job he could be proud of and a family stronger than ever.Then none other than Draco Malfoy showed up in a panic. Next thing he knew his best mate Harry was missing (probably kidnapped knowing his luck) and that Harry and Malfoy were engaged.More problems arise when Ron starts to notice how much time Hermione spends working, How much his mothers health is declining and how much he stops thinking of Malfoy as Malfoy...but as Draco.The cherry on top? Well things start to get more complicated when complex and terrifying feelings start to form between Ron and his best friends fiance—Ron bloomed. “I want to be with you.”Draco didn’t have time for disbelief.

Percy Jackson was betrayed by almost everybody at Camp Half Blood. His girlfriend was unfaithful and overall, there was nothing that tied Percy to Camp anymore. He left America, in hope of never having to speak to a god again. In England, though, Percy learns of an entire new civilization that changes everything that he has ever known. Helped by Hecate and a wizard son of Athena, Percy attempts to assimilate into life at Hogwarts and life as a wizard. With the looming threat of Voldemort and potential death eaters all around, assimilating isn't exactly going right for Percy. Supposed friends look more like enemies and he’s getting in fights left and right from the moment he steps into the castle. As if that isn't enough, Percy learns of an enormous threat that appears at Camp Half Blood. Does he have enough compassion for his old camp to return and help, or will he harden his heart and turn his back on the place he once called home?

Riddle was standing in the same spot, his finger crooked towards her and beckoning her back to him. With a gulp Hermione walked back to where he stood. He lowered his hand and smiled as she stood still before him.           
‘Good girl,’ he purred, and Hermione bristled inside. ‘Now, on your knees.’           
Hermione stared at him in disbelief for a second, until he raised an eyebrow and pointedly looked down at the floor at his feet. Fury building up inside her, Hermione lowered herself to the floor, the thick carpet soft under her knees.
One quick blow job, and her cover would stay intact, and by the end of the night Riddle would be in custody.
She could do this.

When Lily and James Potter wake up one morning, they KNOW something is off. Their street is riddled with Death Eaters and their house is in shambles. ""This isn't a normal morning in heaven,"" they think. And soon they'd learn that they were right; in fact, it wasn't even a morning IN heaven. Some cosmic force had ripped them from their place among the stars and given them a second chance at life. But they soon notice that much has happened in their absence, especially to the ones they love. What will they find? How will they cope? Join James, Lily, and their friends and family on their journey to catching up with the times, with each other, and with themselves;piecebypiece. DISCLAIMER: I do not own ANY of these characters! There are no OCs present in this story and thus all characters belong to JK Rowling and the Harry Potter series.

Ursula Black was only two years old when her mother was killed for resisting Voldemort. She is given to her aunt and uncle, Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy, as Voldemort believes they can raise her to be a 'proper' pureblood. But Narcissa Malfoy has other intentions. After Voldemort's downfall, she secretly sends Ursula to live part time with her estranged sister — Andromeda Tonks. As Ursula grows older and the beliefs of one world collide with the pressures of another, will she be forced to choose a side? Or can she combine the person she was raised to be with the person she wants to be? It is a choice she must make on her own — but who's to say a boy with ginger hair and nice eyes isn't worth fighting for?

Harry Evans is a perfectly normal sixteen year old, thank you very much. Except that... he isn't. Not by anyone's standards. (Not when he can make things move with his mind). He tries not to let it bother him, but he's doing increasingly freakish things, and the world around him is getting stranger and stranger. People are following him, and speaking in metaphors, and somehow knowing his name. It's unnerving.He wonders when his life became this much of a fever dream. Or... Harry Potter somehow slipped under the radar, and now, 5 years after that first Hogwarts letter was sent out, they've finally found him. The world is darker, and more hopeless, and the Harry Potter they get seems like the furthest thing from a beacon of light. He's angry and reckless and world worn. But he's their only hope: the saviour of the Wizarding World. If only he gave a shit.

But when his childhood rival who disappeared mysteriously during Castien's fourth year returns to finish out her Hogwarts education, Castien's plans find themselves in disarray. Her reappearance in his life reignites their rivalry and brings back so many memories...except the one that would explain why they are rivals in the first place.

Harry Potter loved flying from the moment he touched a broom.  Harry Potter hated being famous the moment he found out he was.  He could never settle for playing quidditch professionally while dodging cameras.  Or for being an auror and having to keep facing people who wanted him dead because of Voldemort.  He ran, he had enough help to become someone new, and he became a normal guy with a normal name who could fly and help people and just be happy.  And then he sat in a chair and he was special all over again.  At least this time the details about how special he was were classified.

And a story about Harry, well, not hating his job per say, but it's not like he has much to compare it to and it seemed fine. His whole life seemed fine. Then Malfoy came along with and his flashy suits and fast car making everything seem dull in comparison, and Harry... Harry couldn't just leave well enough alone.

Eighth year, picks up following the Battle of Hogwarts. Unsettled and not sure what his new normal is or should be, Harry is granted refuge at Hogwarts for the summer by Professor McGonagall. Keeping himself at a distance from the rest of the wizarding world and helping the Department of Magical Architecture restore the castle and grounds, he begins to process the last seven years of his life without anyone else's input, which challenges him to begin looking at things, and people, differently. Story then tracks into eighth year and beyond, particularly centering around the most challenging relationship he has to make peace with: Malfoy.

It was unknown to most that when the killing curse hit the toddler, the light was already so bright on the young developing eyes that once it landed directly above his eyes, well, that would be the last time Harry Potter ever saw a thing.-Ron Weasley was.... different, from the rest of her children; He grasped onto things slower than Bill ever did, he didn't run around the house like the twins, he didn't reach for everything he could like Percy and Charlie... it worried her, and made her wonder if the Healers missed something when they checked him over when he was born.-""I'm Hermione Granger!"" she yelled, hardly hearing herself. The other children stared, weird looks on their faces, and ran off giggling. Those, she heard, tears springing to her eyes and her hands unconsciously reached towards the large clunky technology that reseted in her ears.

It’s his punishment and he deserves it he knows, but Severus hadn’t thought James would act so quickly in his discipline because his rut had been less than twenty-four hours ago.  But then again, Severus is always on the run when he knows he has a punishment coming and his Alphas know this.  Really, he can admire their cunning because after the rut and the bite that James had given him, Severus knows he’s certainly easier to locate given that he practically reeks of his Alpha.  As sweet and delicious as Severus’ scent is, he’s an Omega and Omegas' scents are meant to be light so that their allure can be jealously guarded by their Alphas scent-marking them.  Such things aren’t permanent, of course, not until they share a bonding heat.  However, during a rut accompanied by an Alpha bite, the scent is much stronger and it’s that scent precisely that had allowed the pack to so easily track him down.OR: After the events of (K)not Me, Severus finds himself in quite the predicament as his Alphas give him a lesson in discipline that he won't soon forget.

Snape recovers, and just wants everything to calm down so he can get back to teaching, reading and brewing.Hermione realizes that Ron was not the man she thought he was, and is offered a post at Hogwarts. She has nowhere else to go, but nowhere she would rather be. With everyone moving on, all the more quickly due to the new Marriage Law and having left school, she is on her own. At least she still has a good book and a cup of tea, but maybe something more is on its, his, way.

Texas was a jarring change. It was hot in the Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring and when it wasn't boiling hot, it was hailing or flooding. Well, that wasn't fair. The weather could be kind, clear and sunny with a cool breeze, the kind of breeze that he relished blowing through the window in his potions lab in the afternoon.He had grown used to the Texan heat, the Cedar fever he didn't even know was a thing, the sounds of children playing outside at all hours and his overly kind neighbors.

He didn’t know how he got himself into this predicament, much like when Castor’s name was called during the reaping at the goblet of fire.Hugo Ronald Weasley was a normal half-blood wizard of the Gryffindor House, not as overachieving as his mean older sister is but he did take pride excelling in Care of Magical Creatures. Like all other Weasleys; he grew up with a number of family members looking like each other’s carbon copy- signature ginger hair, freckles, and brown eyes. Hugo was spared with lighter locks and hazel orbs from his distant mother’s features but still considered himself plain for only Victoire lucked out on the gene lottery.He could’ve spent the remainder of his years at Hogwarts just as normal student, graduate and get a job far away from Voldemort’s reign and the marriage law but no- he just had to get involved with the Malfoys.This story belongs to the [Of Snakes and Lilies] - A collection of series within the parallel universe where Hadrian did take Draco Malfoy’s hand, Voldemort reigns over Britain, Lily is a potions master and the following generations are a pain in the arse much to Professor Knott’s chagrin but not necessarily in order.

“I’m not.” Harry is. He just - he can’t see it. 
“You can’t see it yet, Potter.” Malfoy sounds miffed.  
“I’m not trying to,” Harry lies, finally tearing his eyes away; he looks out the window in a desperate attempt to get a single thought into his head that isn’t what the fuck.

Rose Weasley and Scorpius Malfoy hate each other which comes as no surprise to anyone. Even if they weren't a Malfoy and Weasley, they would clearly hate each other because they were always tied as top of their classes together, they were rival seekers and they were a Gryffindor and a Slytherin. After an embarrassing moment on the train in their final year, the two find themselves drawn to each other against everything either of them believe and start something that could ruin everything

Remus Lupin is used to having his expectations squashed- they're unrealistic. Who's ever heard of a poor, halfblood werewolf becoming Minister of Magic, after all? But Hogwarts changes this- and a rivalry with a certain Black heir changes his whole worldview. What, and more importantly who, is he willing to sacrifice in order to get to the top?(highly requested that I turn my Slytherin Remus headcanons into a proper fic so here it is! big slowburn sorry guys)this work is gifted to @girlwithacrown and @aavx bc they are always my biggest supporters even when I'm crying over writer's block- I LOVE YOU TWO SO MUCH THANK YOU FOR BLESSING MY LIFE W UR PRESENCE

","
After Voldemort killed Lily and James Potter, he also killed the rest of Harry's relatives. Dumbledore had no choice but to raise the boy himself. Harry Potter grew up in fame, as the Boy Who Lived and knew it too. Everyone loved him, and Harry came to Hogwarts as a charming, mysterious, and reserved celebrity. His fame only increased when year after year Harry and his two best friends, Hermione and Ron, defeated all attempts of the Dark Lord's return. After the war, Harry continued to work his celebrity status to pass new legislation, reform conservative laws, and give sentences to Death Eaters. Hermione quickly rose in the ranks of the Ministry, and Ron had his hands full with a new baby. However, everything changes when Harry sees none other than Draco Malfoy at a charity event, now a renowned potion brewer and collector, although his practice is shrouded in mystery. Harry tries to avoid Draco, but when Hermione and Ron mysteriously grow fond of Draco, Harry must learn to forgive and forget or explain himself. The only problem is, Harry and Draco have some unfinished business from their time at Hogwarts--and that's the most mysterious thing of all.

The easiest way to win a war is to kill the enemy commander; Ron had showed him that, and so had the Wizarding War. It’s easier said than done in a foreign dimension like this, but it’s still doable. Now if only Cor and Gilgamesh would both stop hovering, Harry would be delighted.  (The four years between Cor Leonis stumbling out of the Tempering Grounds alive and being named the Immortal only to vanish from the public eye, and his resurfacing at the side of a young man with very Lucis Caelum features.)

“Lumos,” George whispered the spell into the clear, night air. The cold silence nipped at his nose, and his fingers shirked from their duty of holding the heavy box. But, even without pulling his wand out, the spell took hold, lighting up the back ally of Weasley’s Wizarding Wheezes. The soft glow emanated from his back pocket, illuminating the purple trash bins and brickwork.He took a moment to consider his aims. Just a quick trip, really. Check on Granger. Maybe make her smile. Drop by a few things he thought she’d like.If she was available, maybe they’d work together on their respective projects for a while. He’d be careful not to infringe. The Weasleys had seen less and less of her recently, and she’d left Ron and Hannah’s wedding reception early last week, claiming a headache.But, George had looked up from his friendly conversation with Katie Bell and spotted her from across the room. Her eyes had been red.That wouldn’t do at all.

Instinct, by definition of the Oxford reference, is a complex pattern of behaviour innately determined, which is characteristic of all individuals of the same species. It is also a natural drive that urges the individual towards a particular goal. Animal instinct. Human instinct. At times, a blend of the two. That is what Hermione relies on as she sprints through the dense Scottish forest and harsh spring rain. On four legs, she outpaces the large, ebony wolf nipping at her tail. Shaggy, honey brown coat drenched and weighed her down, yet she continued to remain out of reach of the alpha. Only just out of reach, but she enjoyed an exhilarating hunt, even if she was to be the prey. Of a sense, mostly. TOMIONE SMUTFEST 2020: A/B/O AU prompt

Much later that evening, with Draco nestled naked between them, Theo looked over at Hermione. Draco was fast asleep, curled with his arms thrown around Hermione and his feet pressed against Theo’s shins. In sleep his worried frown had disappeared and he looked years younger. Hermione was still awake, and she smiled sadly and reached over to take Theo’s hand, resting them on Draco’s side. He murmured in his sleep and snuggled closer to Hermione. ‘I hate seeing him like this,’ Theo admitted, and Hermione squeezed his hand in sympathy. ‘Me too,’ she whispered. ‘I wish there was something we could do to help him.’‘I wish we could just keep him here. The three of us could just hideaway here, ride out the war and stay safe.’ If Theo hadn’t chosen that moment to sigh and fall back onto the pillows, maybe there would have been a clue in Hermione’s eyes as to what she was really thinking. As it was, there was a pause before she replied.‘If only we could bring this stupid war to a quicker end somehow.’

As if Harry didn’t have his hands full already, Draco Malfoy has made a comeback from the dead to torment him. However, this is not the Malfoy he knows, this one apologises to him occasionally, and his blasted tanned skin and gold-streaked hair are unknowingly making Harry want things he shouldn’t want. He’s just trying to do his job.It’s been ten years since Harry defeated Voldemort. He has been promoted to Head Auror a year ago, and now into his arms there has fallen a case of illegal memory potions being sold. If he wasn’t busy enough as it was, somehow Draco Malfoy has managed to tangle his name up in the case, and neither of them seem to get rid of the other, no matter how hard they try.Harry is plagued by the realization that while everyone else’s life moves forward, his doesn’t seem to do so, and there aren’t many people who understand what he’s been through. Unfortunately, that one blond tosser with his sneering manner is managing to slowly make himself feel like an inevitability.

Just your typical Nico di Angelo goes to Hogwarts story, except where it isn't. (I hope) Nico just wanted to live a normal life, or at least as normal as you can get for a son of Hades. He wanted to hang out with his friends and his sister. He wanted to redecorate the Hades cabin because, gods it's ugly. He wanted to spend time with Will Solace and be at peace for once. Having his father and the goddess of magic appear on his doorstep smashes any chance for peace. He still didn't know why he felt like he knew the Percy look-alike though.Harry Potter was ready to go insane. Cut off from the wizarding world and then attacked by dementors. He is beyond confused. First of all he has no idea what Voldemort was up to. Second of all he's been having weird dreams lately and could barely remember them when he woke up. Lastly was the whole deal with the American transfer student. Harry couldn't figure out why he seemed so familiar.Takes place after Heroes of Olympus, during Order of the Phoenix.

“Why, Padfoot?” Remus asked, his voice apologetic. As if he was already aware of what the answer was, as if he regretted the mere thought of asking him to explain. There were doors left locked in Grimmauld Place because of the horrors that lay within. Sirius, a Black to his core, was much the same.“You know why.”“Yes,” came Remus’ sickeningly gentle and reluctant agreement, “but I think it’d still help if you explained.”“Oh,” Sirius laughed a little just under his breath. Even to his own ears, the sound was too hysterical to be of actual amusement. “Because we’re both so well versed. Talking about things, the thing we do best. Fantastic idea, that.”

Percy walks into the Wizengamot and calls for votes against the measure.  He makes a principled, brave stand: Bellatrix Lestrange was barking mad.  Nothing could have prevented her.  She and Morgana and Nimue and Grindelwald do not set a precedent that women and confirmed bachelors and childless people are mad and dangerous.  Children are not some Midas touch of goodness, he says into a ringing silence. 
Three weeks later, Percy drinks a cup of tea in a staff meeting, chokes, and begins to turn to gold.

The long-game personified.--Harry would never have guessed that his animagus would have been a snake. Nor the trouble it would bring when Voldemort found out.

Pansy couldn’t explain how right it felt. The pure certainty that everything in her world seemed to point to him. Her heart beat for the man. She’d descended into a spiral of chaos when he, for the briefest moment, wasn’t hers. His words had seared into her, and his touch—a touch which felt innocent for so long now felt so different, like it was something personal—hers. It made her want nothing more than to give him everything he wanted, and more. To Lucius, her Lucius. Of course. Of course, it was him.-----Smart, stylish, spirited Pansy was the perfect example of what an elegant Pureblooded witch ought to be. With a passion for match-making, she seldom worried about finding love for herself. So why, when Pansy could have any man she wanted, could she not get her dearest friend and closest confidant out of her head?Modern-era story inspired by Jane Austen's  Emma. Written for Fairest of the Rare Spring Fest.

Draco goes back to Hogwarts after the battle as part of his probation and learns a lot about himself and his classmates.It is a story of healing and acceptance with the characters finding their place in the world after the war and thinking about what they want that world to look like. Things will be difficult at first with tension amongst the characters, many of them still suffering the after effects of the war. However slowly, they will start to understand and support each other as existing relationships continue and new ones form. On top of this Harry and Draco (but Draco especially) haven’t really had any experience of relationships and are still trying to work out their sexuality and what they want from life as they are now able to look to the future in a way they never really thought they could.This story is set immediately after the final battle at Hogwarts and will take us through the next year (and a bit!) after the war. The idea is that it could be the next book in the series after DH, however, as a bit of a twist, Draco is the main character, not Harry. It is canon-compliant with all the events of the books but ignores the epilogue and the later events of The Cursed Child. Full summary inside.

This story is not set in the wizarding world, but rather just ordinary life. Draco is tired of his stressful life as the CEO of Malfoy Company. One day he decides to take a closer look at the small bakery that lies between his home and the Company. He finds the peaceful atmosphere to be just what he needed, and it doesn't hurt that the black-haired pastry girl is cute. However, seeing the similar-looking, but manly black-haired guy that also seems to work there, catches Draco's attention. Who is he? Why did Draco have to stare at him? It was just because of the guy being unusually handsome, right?  That was definitely it...  A story of a tired CEO worker, and a carefree bakery owner.

After the war Draco Malfoy is sentenced to Azkaban for a really long sentence. Apparently aiding in Dumbledore's death overrules any argument Harry could put up for him.After the trial, as the days pass by, Harry is more and more outraged at the sentence. He can't stop obsessing over the fact that Draco Malfoy saved his life and aided him during the war and is very much capable of redemption. Not to mention that Malfoy has always been a delicate git and would never survive Azkaban.After a few weeks obsessing Harry decides that Malfoy indeed can't remain unjustly in Azkaban and starts to plot a way to break him out of jail and hide him in Grimmauld Place. When Hermione finds out she's not amused. Ron is horrified. Draco still thinks he's hallucinating.

The two students walked to the far end of the table casually, slipping in next to what looked like Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini. The conversations slowly came back up, softer than it was before, but Harry couldn't focus on anything but the boy.Not only was his hair different, Harry noticed, but his whole wardrobe was too. The pastel boy had ill fitting robes on, and light pink earrings in his ears. When he rolled up his sleeves, the Dark Mark -a mark that Voldemort had given his followers, was gone completely, in its place laid an arrangement of flowers and what looked like writing.""Did you know he was coming back?""

They had to keep it from their friends, their teachers, families. All that pressure sometimes just gets too much.-In which Hermione develops an eating disorder and Draco deals with his own fair share of mental health issues and trauma.

He was ashamed to say that his first thought was that he'd gone a little hard on the drink and had taken a psycho home with him.

Tom Riddle is an enigma to all who meet him. Polite beyond measure, celebrated across factions, and incredibly composed to an almost ridiculous degree. Yet so little is known about what he's like outside of practiced smiles and reserved interactions. Truly, many see him as the epitome of a sort of outward perfection, a figure whose true thoughts are hidden away and unattainable to practically all who try.And then a particular someone is injured, and the facade comes crashing down.

Draco and Neville talked about the ‘Lord of the Rings’ and how far they were up to with occasional commentary from Hermione - the book series was recommended by Harry and they’d already devoured the previously recommended book, ‘The Hobbit’. Harry was enthusiastically telling Susan Bones about “the one time I won an axe-throwing competition” that Hermione kept glancing at him nervously over.Well, the meal was going well until Professor Quirrell burst into the Great Hall, “Troll! Troll in the dungeon! Thought you oughta know…” and fainted right where he stood.AKAHow the Donahue Gang deals with a troll at their Halloween feast

Once upon a time, Harry Potter was killed and Voldemort won the war. Things went from bad to worse, and strangely enough, this was even true for those that had supported Voldemort. Nothing in the world was as it should have been.And then there was a second chance, and things changed. They did not, however, change nicely or easily or even willingly.Note: Originally written and posted to LiveJournal in 2006; doesn't draw on the movies or anything after Half-Blood Prince (and diverges from that book).

""Do you resent me?” James suddenly asks. Remus doesn't avert his gaze from the star-scattered sky. “The number of people that I resent has drastically increased these last years, but you’re not one of them, no.” They stay quiet for a while, until Remus speaks again. “Do you resent yourself?” James runs his hand through his hair. “I don’t know.

When he arrives at the castle, he is confronted by former colleague Neville Longbottom, who is now Herbology professor. Neville insists on proving that Draco is innocent, and he isn't the only one meddling in Greg's investigation.  Mycroft Holmes, who occupies a 'minor position' in the Ministry of Magic, knows more than he he's letting on about what’s lurking at Hogwarts and in what way it threatens everything he cares about.

Written for Hermione's Nook Anniversary Drabble Fest. Prompt: It's five minutes to midnight on NYE, and Person A is looking for Person B to give them their first kiss of the year. Just before midnight, they finally find each other.

A bright, familiar laugh rang out over the din and Remus felt his heart leap in his chest, automatically scanning the crowd for a shock of red hair. Despite his protests to the contrary Remus couldn’t deny the feelings of affection, protectiveness and, yes, lust that Lily Evans stirred in him. That he was a werewolf never seemed to bother her, and he had long considered her his best friend, time spent bonding over books and homework and rolling their eyes at the other Marauder’s antics blossoming into  fancy on his part.
Grabbing up the shot that had been set on the bar for a woman paying less attention to it than her date Remus tossed it back, letting the alcohol instill him with a confidence he rarely felt in everyday life before he pushed into the crowd, intent on finding her. Purpose fuelled his steps, Sirius’s words echoing in his mind as a desperate sort of hope that he was right, Lily felt the same, filled him.

In a world where Hunters are aware of the wizarding world, some distrust those born with magic as much as the witches made from human sacrifice and demon deals, while others take advantage of their gifts, and some see them as allies. Two years ago, Dean was one of the first type, until he met and teamed up with Hermione Granger. Now, with his father missing, he has to balance his relationship with a (good) witch, reestablish his bond with his brother, find his father, and when he does -- keep that father from shooting his girl.

The first time one of them said I love you, they were fourteen. Harry broke off the kiss-- their fifth, the night of the Yule Ball-- and whispered it reverently in Draco’s ear. Draco fake gagged all over Harry, but a few weeks later, shivering from the cold of the lake (“I thought it’d be a toss-up between you or Ron,” Harry’d said), he said it too. Harry pretended he’d just smelled something vile.

A heart rotting curse, if Harry expected to die, it would have certainly been in a painful way. Just perhaps not by one of the worst curses that didn't fit into the unforgivables.Hermione and Ron had at least passed before him, so Harry's not too miffed about dying. He doesn't even mind that their group healer is too magically exhausted to cast the counter curse. It is a complex bit of magic and the healer had been working tirelessly to keep Harry's force of four alive against Voldemort.

Harry was still out there and if Remus could see him, even if it was just once, maybe it would give him the motivation to carry on. But when he arrived at the Dursley's house, he found something that shook him to the core.

Granger. Why did it always have to be Granger who occupied his thoughts?If only she wasn’t a Mudblood. Her being Gryffindor wasn’t a big problem. Her being smart was great, he was secretly really annoyed with how dumb some of the Slytherin girls are. Her being feisty was annoying but he kind of liked the challenge. Her being at the ball with Krum obviously meant that others saw she was desirable too. Her being Mudblood was… Damn. Maybe he was the one with the problem, not her.

She fought in one war, only to be thrust into another. Well... at least the second one seemed easier... Right?Being a half-blood was hell on Earth during Voldemort's war, but she had made it through. She had once had one of the most promising futures as an International Dueling Champion, having already won several trophies and titles. She would even bet that she knew more magic than the Malfoy's. But none of that mattered because her mum was muggleborn. With her parents dead, her home destroyed and no other family, she didn’t have much tying her to Britain anymore.That was lucky since she didn't think she would see Britain again...***Undergoing minor editing but still posting new chapters!***

But I don’t even know if he’s gay, and even if he is, he would probably never like me like that.”“Sirius, I’ve never met a rational person who didn’t like you.” Remus soothed. “I’m sure whoever this guy is, he thinks you’re amazing.” “I’m not sure. The thing is, we’re really good friends, and I’m afraid that I’ll jeopardize that, if I tell him how I feel.” Sirius sighed.  “I’m gonna go up. You coming?”""No, I think I'll stay down here and read."" Remus answered, pulling out the book he had brought with him. ""Night, Pads.""""Night, Moony,""Remus sat there, in front of the fire, reading for what could have been hours. He kept getting distracted, however, by that feeling, those butterflies that had suddenly erupted.

Not when he’s head over heels for someone else.'

The room was dark and cold; several figures wearing black robes stood in a circle around a tall, pale, man, and the giant snake resting in his arms. Their faces were concealed by heavy hoods and their heads were lowered as a gesture of respect. They barely dared to breathe, terrified of missing a single word from their leader's speech.
 “There are many prominent witches and wizards who might join our ranks after the school year ends tomorrow. Watch them when they come home on Saturday and report the results to me,” a cold voice echoed in the silence. They knew that the summer of 1978 would be difficult for them, but they didn't realize how their lives would change once they choose the side. Voldemort is rising and The Order wants to stop him; but will they be able to? The Death Eaters are not going to let them win this war.What will happen to everyone? Will James and Lily survive at the end? Is it possible for Regulus and Sirius to become brothers ever again? Does Snape have a chance for redemption?

Severus Snape was not a good man. He had proved that many years ago. His attempts at redemption had still not been enough for him, and so he was very surprised that someone else had decided that they had certainly been enough for them.

After everything he'd gone through, all Harry wanted was to live a normal life. He didn't want there to be anything extraordinary about him, not one bit. He didn't want to make the papers anymore. He didn't want his name laced into anyone's rumours or gossip. All he wanted was to be at peace for once in his bloody miserable life.When Harry Potter finally finds himself ready to come out, it starts to feel like life is giving him more questions than answers. The last place he expects to find any sort of solace is at Draco Malfoy's doorstep. But something about Malfoy just...feels like all those little missing pieces of himself are coming together in a way he just doesn't think he can ignore.A 30-day Pride-focused Drarry challenge.

“Well, consider me at your service, if you ever need someone to use, say, for exacting a secret revenge on a thoughtless husband.” He smirked, and her jaw may very well have dropped. Had he just offered to cheat on her husband with her?“What? Here and now?” Hermione laughed nervously. The fact that she hadn’t whipped out her wand and cursed him for even making such a suggestion was evidence of how angry she must really be with Ronald, if not of how drunk she must really be. “That’s insane.” At least she could claim insanity later, right? Her heart was pounding now, so much so she thought he must have been able to hear it. She swore she could. She should run. Any decent married woman would. Why, then, did her feet refuse to move?“And that wasn’t a no,” he informed her. They stared at each other with baited breath. Draco took a step towards her, reaching one hand up to draw her towards him.

When Harry Potter went onto the train the second time in his life, he never expected to become Master of Death, which meant he never died but went into Rebirth instead.

Draco Malfoy never asked for a second chance, nor did he particularly want one. But he found himself in his old body at eleven, and after a year at Hogwarts, he has a plan for the year before him: keep to himself, find Dobby, improve relations with fellow Slytherins to cordial but distant, get over this stupid obsession with Harry Potter, and no more jokes about controlling a Malfoy mountain troll. No one else thinks they're funny. And no more cursing people- well, only as many people as necessary...Draco Malfoy has never been very good at following plans.

The Sorting Ceremony was very important. However, students were not always sorted where they wanted. -----------------------------------------------Wei Ying was reckless, proud, and shameless, like his mother. The professors didn't doubt that the Sorting Hat would sort him out in Gryffindor. Cangse Sanren was a Gryffindor, like her husband. She was one of the greatest witch of her generation, a Muggle-born: she never let anyone use her origins against her, hating Malfoy and Black for their cult of blood purity. Her death had shocked everyone. When Jiang Fengmian saw Wei Ying, he hoped that the boy ended up in Gryffindor, so he could control and protect him. The Sorting Hat had a different idea,"" Ravenclaw!""Lan Qiren almost choked on his pumpkin juice.

Can their relationship survive jealous lions, meddlesome snakes, N.E.W.T.S. and a year of Friday night quidditch games?  If Hermione has anything to say about it, they'll come out of the other side stronger than ever.  Hopefully fate agrees.

Harry Potter somewhat reluctantly returns to Hogwarts after the war to finish his schooling. It's more difficult than he imagines to find routine again, faced with the realities of living in the space where so many died and so many things went terribly wrong. With a hefty amount of therapy, a lot of aimless wandering, and a redefining of several relationships, Harry does manage to begin to find a new normal, though that normal is somehow no less complicated than his life was before. 
(Or: Harry needs to figure out who he is without the war and his destiny motivating him, and so does Draco Malfoy. Somehow, they end up doing it together.)

Following a decades long war the Malfoy kingdom must make allies with those they'd tried to eradicate, or face that fate themselves. What seemed impossible somehow was anything but, as in only a handful of months the Malfoy heir was betrothed to his Royal Majesty the King, Harry James Potter. Yet the differences between the Potter and Malfoy kingdoms are stark, and as the two unlikely spouses could tell you, full of all these fucking thorns.

Harry returns to Hogwarts for his eighth year and everything is different. The people, the atmosphere, the studying. He can't seem to catch a break - oh, and he's horny all the freaking time. When Draco and Harry somehow start to act civil around each other, they realize they have similar problems. They have an idea: Let's drink some dangerous love potion to feel attracted to each other and fuck their brains out to release some pressure. What could go wrong? Nothing, right? Only that Harry slowly, very slowly, begins to realize that maybe he doesn't need a love potion to fall in love with Draco.

Rage: violent uncontrollable anger.Harry was angry. Angry at the old coot for keeping that from him. Angry at his supposed friends stealing from him. Angry that he is placed with those muggles again. His anger was burning him from the inside out and normally he squashed it but not this time. This time, he accepted it, welcomed it. Made it a cup of tea, added biscuits and offered his best chairs. Told it to make itself at home. He also told his welcome visitor, to stay as long as they want. Anger gave a wicked grin. Oh, he was staying for a long time. Labelled as mature - just the themes. I'm sorry if this triggers anyone, I don't mean to. So far, there is abuse. Most likely add more themes in later e.g gore and stuff. Disclaimer: I do not own Harry Potter and co. Just the plot! They belong to the awesome J.K Rowling

Prompted by @justdyingontheinside on Tumblr: Harry is a photographer and he always takes photos of Draco

“Enough,” Draco said, briefly shutting his eyes. Seven years and he was still as pathetic. He started gathering his belongings. “Excuse me, I have to leave.”


“I haven’t even started.”


“There is nothing for us to talk about.”


“There’s plenty, actually.”


Draco pushed himself out of the booth. “Oh, shut your—”


A warm hand grabbed his wrist. Draco, shocked into silence, stopped. Harry tightened his grasp, firm enough to keep Draco from leaving but gentle enough not to hurt.


“Draco.” He swallowed. “Stay.”

Harry Potter has returned from his seven-year world tour and is back in London, with a photography exhibition. Draco is not prepared.

It's Tom Riddle's fifth year at Hogwarts, and between trying to balance his classes, staying as far away from Dumbledore as possible, and gathering followers in hopes of taking over the Ministry in the future, he does not need the mysterious snake-like flowers appearing on his pillow every morning. He also really doesn't need the Head Boy, Dorian Beaufils, showing up wherever he is, because honestly, it's quite annoying. And what's even more angering, is that it's also quite endearing. No matter that Beaufils' eyes are so eerily similar to those of the monster residing in the Chamber.

Right on queue, Sirius burst through the large doors of the great hall, Harry on his arms, walking towards the teachers table.All eyes were on him and of course he used that to his advantage (as if him being late wasn't planned in the first place).“Oh darling, you're already here I thought we agreed on walking here together, I looked all over for you.” He yelled across the whole hall over to Remus, who just rolled his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose in exasperation. Harry giggled in Sirius' arms, playing with his hair that hung loosely over his shoulder.or Sirius and Remus are Professors at Hogwarts and run into a little bit of a problem when Molly can't take care of Harry for the day.

Lily Evans was many things. She was a witch first and foremost, and currently – though not for very much longer – in her 5th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was a proud Gryffindor. She was muggleborn, the first witch in her family. She was a talented potion maker, often spending her free time down in the dungeons mixing her brews and revelling in the multicoloured fumes. She was a dab hand at her charm work and liked to summon little sparkling lights to brighten up her study spaces. She was a passionate friend. She was bright, loved nothing more than spending her afternoons listening to records in the sun, and adored being outdoors surrounded by nature. Yes, Lily Evans was many things.But at that precise moment, on a sunny afternoon in June after having just sat her Defence Against the Dark Arts O.W.L, she was absolutely fucking furious.|| Or, what happened after that incident at the lake.

Hufflepuff, to everyone’s surprise, is rumored to be a top contender to win the inter-house Quidditch Cup. Returning for her eighth year, Hermione is recruited by Ginny and the Gryffindor house team to spy on Hufflepuff’s Quidditch practices in order for them to gain insider information. The only problem is that Hermione knows little about the sport of Quidditch. Disguising herself as a Hufflepuff student, she has an accidental run-in with Draco. He attempts to befriend her Hufflepuff persona, Robbie Fenwick. Leveraging a friendship with Draco, she asks him to help her learn the sport so she can be of use to her house team. Draco and Robbie become friends, but what starts as intrigue for Hermione turns into feelings for him.

This is the Deathly Hallows continuation of my last fic, ""For enemies."" It builds on the Drarry interactions in JKR's plot and then some. Nothing is too inconsistent in terms of the unfolding events, but there are definitely twists. This one has less explicit smut (only a couple of scenes towards the end) but more angst, feelings, tension, and buildup. Also, Draco is, like, capital G Good and definitely more helpful than is probably realistic at this stage in his life.

Lupus Wysteria Malfoy was not your average Malfoy female. Sure, she enjoyed wearing dresses, attending dinner parties, and spending time with her family, but there was one major difference. 
She cared deeply about those her family rejected. They interested her and she did not believe they were beneath her. She wasn't more deserving of magic than they were and she certainly wasn't better than them in any manner. Except perhaps at studying, but that wasn't what the phrase ""better than them"" meant in this situation.
Her feelings grow and grow and soon she realizes she cannot live as her family does anymore.
However, change is not accepted in the Malfoy house and this puts her on the brink of danger.
No side will accept her, leaving her alone. Will she be able to find help, or will she finally be broken?
This is her story.

~“Thank you.” Remus ran a hand through his soaked curls. “Sirius, I-” Come on, Lupin. “I-” Remus walked in, past Sirius, and shut the door. “Sirius, I- Can I kiss you? I’ve wanted to kiss you again for an eternity.”Sirius stuttered a little, and dragged a hand over his face. “Remus?! What-” he put his hands on his hips, his cheeks a little flustered. “What?!”“Oh my fucking God. I ruined it.”~Remus Lupin is a 27 year old junior-associate at lawfirm Slughorn & Fortescue. For three years, his hard work and dedication have gone unnoticed. He lives in a shabby flat, with mountains of student loans, and has already accepted his fate of being stuck in his little cubicle forever when senior partner, and court-room legend, Kingsley Shacklebolt calls him up to his office. Remus then meets Sirius Black, the embodiment of beautify and grace, and from that moment on his life changes. He gets to work with the big-shots, and prove his worth as a lawyer. Although... However his plea against work-place relationships and too handsome men may be, he can't help but fall for his boss' secretary.

Harry lost everything and everyone,the final battle was disastrous . Many were dead and he wished only have a normal life, just be the son of a Marauder. He wished he weren't the BWL. It is impossible to change the past,but there is a detail that young Potter doesn't know. When he was a baby his magic core was divided into two bodies,yours and yours in another dimension.Harry end up in a dimension where his parents are alive and the second wizarding war never happened, but does that mean the world is at peace? Not everything is as it seems.

The fallen Slytherin wasn't acting from a place of altruism, though, and Hermione knows it. He wants something from her, but she can't guess what it might be or the depths of his obsession with her until he makes himself available for use by the Second Order of the Phoenix.

Doesn’t he know that he can literally just write his name - and nothing but his name - on any application for anything and it will be accepted?” Shacklebolt held up the said application that was there for his review, courtesy of Podmore, who’d vetted out the useless ones. “But he really went and wrote about the time he blew up his aunt for ‘When has the Committee acted in your life?

Harry was just a 7 year old boy trying to get some sleep before having to do chores. But life is never normal if you're Harry James Potter. Read as Harry talks to Death, gets removed from the Dursleys and put into Grimmauld Place with everyone's favourite godparents, Padfoot and Moony. Hold up, how did he talk to Death!? You better read to find out! Voldemort is 100% dead in this book, but Dumbledore doesn't believe it.

And not just in that way.

Magic was a complicated and wonderful thing. On several occasions it has been known to not only bend the rules of physics but outright break them, and in more dubious cases it had even gone head to head with the laws of nature as well. On one such night a certain Lily Potter fervently claims that it had rained indoors. This response, however, was only solicited upon asking Mrs. Potter a specific set of questions on what exactly took place on her front porch, February 23rd 1979, after a group of friends met at the Potter home for pleasant conversation and drink. Other responses include: “None of your business,” “Don’t you have work to be doing,” and “So help me, James, if you don’t go away!”

One day, a young girl sits on the edge of a well. On this day, she falls in. Then the next, she’s not even a ‘she’ anymore. He’s Peter Pettigrew — doomed to die at the hands of his (betrayed) friend’s son.Peter is selfish, bitter and brash. He’s not some fairy tale hero, he doesn’t care if everyone around him dies, as long as he lives. The marauders are annoying and childish. Survival is his priority, and he can’t afford to face distractions. This just makes the fact that soulmates are now apparently a thing all the more godawful.(And then another day years later he falls into an entirely new impossibility, Remus Lupin in tow, right into the third book of Harry Potter. Smack bang on the other Peter Pettigrew’s grave).It’s confusing and graceless, and entirely something that would happen to him of all people.—update schedule: have not forgotten, just <3 depressed <3working on the new chapter now

Malfoy turned from her now to her sister. Petunia’s eyes were glazed, streaming unending tears, and her mouth slack. It was as if she had been transported back to girlhood. Gone were the hard lines of her face. Like curtains parting, Lily saw her sister as she once was: wide eyed, curious, and innocent; before Hogwarts, before magic.
  “Now, what shall we do with you, my dear? Shall we show Lily darling what happens when people like her take what isn’t theirs?” His voice was soft and persuasive. He spoke as if to a close confidant. Withdrawing his wand from his robe sleeve, he turned it on Petunia. “What do you think, Miss Evans? Shall we have a quick show and tell?” || When Death Eaters attack her family, Lily must try to protect them at all costs. If only it was that easy. But at least James Potter is there to pick up the pieces.

Harry has been through a lot during his first year. Dumbledore is well aware of that. What he did not know was about the dreams Harry had been having. Dreams of the first year of his life before a once happy family was broken. These dreams of the past, along with protective friends and family are what change Harry's path, giving him and his friends the chance to do more than they thought they could. Dumbledore has to rethink his plans for the Boy-Who-Lived, after the people who care enough to see the truth set his priorities straight. Harry is given a new home, a new chance, and above all a new life that he chooses to base on what he learns of his past from his dreams. This includes rebuilding the Marauders legacy in a new way and preparing for what's to come. It's not like he's oblivious to the fact Voldemort will keep coming after him, right?

 “'Some speak of a ring,’” Mr. Weasley began, “‘that lies nestled on a dark, crumbling twig in a clearing in the woods. The woods are dark, unforgiving, and many are warned against going within the trees―some might even say it's forbidden,’” He winked at Harry then, who couldn’t help but roll his eyes. 
“So, it’s a fairy tale about the Forbidden Forest.” 
“Yes, I suppose so,” Said Mr. Weasley, and straightened with a slight wince to tell him firmly, “and I know you’ve got a history of tromping around in there, so I’m telling you now,  do not go back in there to look for rings. Bad idea.” 
Stories are just stories—nothing more, nothing less. Morals and lessons can be gleaned by parables and fables alike, but the truth of it is so. That’s what people believe, at least. And that’s exactly what makes them so dangerous.There's a grain of truth in every tale. Harry learns this the hard way when a fairy tale Arthur tells him comes to life, and he’s forced to abandon the wizarding world at the worst possible time—by winding up stuck in 1942 for six months. 
Believe it or not, being Tom Riddle's unwitting roommate isn't even the worst part of it.

[Excerpt:] Eleven schools struck me as very little and homeschooling is all well and good, but where does that leave the muggleborns? Would they constantly break the statute of secrecy because their magic is through no fault of their own untrained? How many muggleborns are there anyways? For that matter, how many witches and wizards are there? I set out to discover the answers to these questions, through math and logic and the liberal application of google to the problem. Allow me to take you along on this journey, on which I discovered what I like to call: The Trouble With JKR’s Math.

Presumed dead from the moment she was born, Katrina Potter has led a sheltered life, hidden away from the wizarding world for her own safety. Upon Voldemort's return, she is thrust back into the world that for years, she was forced to learn about from her books and through staring out her bedroom window. With so many questions swirling around her supposed return from the dead, she finds herself under an even harsher spotlight than her brother, a constant subject of scrutiny by the Ministry and her peers. Under threat of an impending war, Katrina adjusts to her new reality, while protecting her brother from those who mock him, including a certain blonde Slytherin, and his own stubbornness, and unbeknownst to them, she could be the key to tipping the war in favor of the light or the dark.

Dumbledore seems to be controlling the strings, and harry's friends seem different.First fic so constructive criticism is welcome but please tell me what to improve not just that there are errors in the fic/chapter.

Inside, Hermione bypassed the wooden desk at the front completely and led me toward the back of the small shop. The walls held framed prints of tattoos, some still and some clearly magical. My eyes fixed on an inked serpent peering up between two scandalously naked breasts, tongue flickering out intermittently. “Are you sure we’re supposed to just walk right in?” Was artwork like this even allowed on Diagon Alley? This felt more like Knockturn.“Yes, they’re expecting us.” She paused outside the door. “Now, listen. I’d like you to keep an open mind about the tattoo artist and not react…hastily.”“Oi, bring him in already!” The unmistakable voice of Ron Weasley cut through the door.Hermione intertwined her fingers with mine before I could escape.

Hey everyone. As the title says, this is an alternative ending for Norische's brilliant story; Follow MeThis is just a nice wrap up after the events of the 'last chapter' of that story. I know I may have skipped a thing or two, since it would probably take me a few chapters to adress everything properly, but I do hope you still like the way it turned out. Also, we have different writings, so you may notice a thing or two that are not as in the main story, but please understand.

Surely, any wizard who knows pureblood circles, knows you’re nothing to someone unless you can name their second cousin three times removed, as well as know exactly who in their family not to mention at dinner. Who was this Dark Lord’s second cousin three times removed? And why was he clearly not mentioning any of his family at dinner?Regulus realises he might have found a way to make the idea of his joining the Dark Lord as repugnant to his fanatical pureblood mother as it is to him. Unfortunately, especially when it comes to avoiding a war, we often meet our fate on the road we take to avoid it.

Voldemort was one of the most famous and earliest artists from the Renaissance Era and arguably the most famous English one. He painted, sculpted countless statues for the public, royalty, and nobles alike.His most famous painting wasn’t a commission nor a piece that he had planned to make money off. It went under the name “The Potterer”, presumably the last painting (and the best work) of Voldemort. Tom Riddle, Voldemort’s last living descendant was given the responsibility to take care of the expensive paintings.AndHarry Potter… Well, Harry didn’t know why everyone kept mistaking him for the person in the painting. What was so special about it anyway? It was just a portrait of someone!

In a universe where the Ministry of Magic controls more about you, than you control about yourself. The Ministry of Magic assigns you a spouse and you're stuck with them whether you like it or not.Sirius Black openly hated Severus Snape and was not shy about the fact that he loved his best friend. When Sirius Black is presented with a marriage summons he cannot ignore, he finds out the true definition of sleeping with the enemy. 
“can seven years of good memories make up for the seven years of bad ones?” “We didn’t get married because we wanted to,” Snape says, “We got married because we had to,” Snape says. “You can have your boy apologize to my son,” Snape says firmly. Sirius watches Snape for a moment, trying not to grin, as he figures out what Snape was really saying, “Tell me,” Sirius says, sitting down on Snape’s lap. “I know,” Snape says looking back at Sirius, “but your side is outnumbered.” Leaving the thin wizard on the ground unmasked, bleeding. “I would die for our child, if it came down to it,” Snape says firmly. There was no way in hell that Sirius had just admitted to giving him a love potion.

‘Why,’ Hermione wanted to ask, after every use of her first name, and when his heated gaze lingered on her. There was nothing that she could give him aside from caring for his son, though he never treated her as a mere governess. The times that she spent with Draco, regardless of whether Tom was between them, or not were her favorite, regardless of the impossible dreams they encouraged. She knew without a doubt that she wanted to stay, though she knew that she could not if Draco took another as his mate. There were letters in her desk left unsealed and unsent, ones she intended for the Longbottoms and other neighboring families, like the Parkinson’s. All had children that she could care for, and she knew that she could work anywhere with Draco’s recommendation. The thought made her heart desperately ache, as everything within her demanded that she stay. Tom lay asleep still in her lap, reminding her of who she would abandon if she sought another position. Still...she longed to stay.Historical Werewolf AU | A certain governess and her employer pine for one another

With the knowledge of the fate of the world and everyone around her, Hermione feels like quite a bit of responsibility has been thrust upon her. But of course, despite having the fate of the universe in her palms, Sirius Black still somehow manages to make himself Hermione’s number one concern and priority—especially as Hermione accidentally lets on she knows entirely too much about Sirius and his friends.--here's a spotify playlist for this sin of a fic lol--april 23 2022: again on hiatus. currently working on next chapter; unsure when it'll be out. aiming for before 2 year anniversary lmao

The littlest Weasley, seventh to be born to her mother and father, was brought squealing and shrieking into a world with more brothers than anyone could ever hope for. Their cosy ramshackle home was always fit to bursting with people cooing at her, cradling her, rocking her to sleep, and her earliest years were rich with love, though unfortunately not rich with much of anything else.It was only when she was about five years old or so, that she realised there was something terribly wrong: her brothers were treating her as if she were the same as them.   title from the song ""i forget where we were"" by ben howard

Shortly before Sirius Black escapes from prison, Dumbledore invited Remus Lupin to take up the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor. When dementors stop the Hogwarts Express to look for the escaped fugitive, Remus does what he can to protect the students under his watch, but at the same time he can't help but remember several long ago moments in which he WAS harboring his old friend. (Basically it's Remus's POV of Chapter 5 of PoA. I'm bad at summaries. Forgive me.)

Grindelwald won, and the Wizarding World has been restructured. Wizards are divided into their designations of owners and pets, and then the rest who were neither. Only those who have the resources, care, and love enough to properly teach and look after a pet were granted their license of ownership. Muggle-borns, half-bloods, and Dumbledore supporting families were the pets; to be guided in the ways of the Wizarding World, to make them the best wizards they could be.Severus Snape knew he was to be a pet ever since he knew what magic was, and he wanted to be a good one too. He just hoped that Lady Magic would grant him a master that would be good to him.(Lady Magic decided to give him one that would love him too.)(Further detailed warnings in each chapter, but i'm a soft person so i write soft things, its basically just fluff and smut)

Everyone experiences feelings of yearning. Whether its an object, a person, or a specific time and place.We all yearn for something.  A yearning we often experience is nostalgia, a yearning for distorted, melancholic past of better days.(Y/N) often yearns for the past, yearning for what was once there if it was there at all. The past will never leave her, she can never forget it nor can she fully embrace it. She's a rebellious girl with a strong exterior that's endured so much, but inside there's the dark emptiness. More than once does she find herself to be a scapegoat, she does her fair share of trouble, engaging in fights to protect students from bullying. Hogwarts was the opportunity she desperately needed in her life to discovering herself, her capabilities, and newfound relationships that will include a familiar brooding boy, Severus Snape, and werewolf Remus Lupin.

He had thought it was the end of the line for him. He was dead on the battlefield, and for some odd reason, he couldn’t find it in himself to regret. He expects to fade into nothingness, to see darkness and then feel nothing but an eternal abyss. He supposed that maybe he would see Corazon in the afterlife, if such a thing existed, but even as he took his final breath he was skeptical. Still, he didn’t expect the sensation of drowning. Nor did he expect the bright light that followed to cause him to gasp and sob for breath.Update (01.05.2022) - ABANDONED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE

Naturally, Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are the ones sent to retrieve it.To Harry, it really doesn't matter that Draco's hair is an awfully remarkable shade of silky platinum. Or that you can't tell the difference between his smirks and his genuine smiles unless you're staring at that tiny dimple on his left cheek that only appears when he's actually happy. Or that his brand of sarcasm is so maddeningly endearing they should bottle it and sell it in shops, because Harry would buy it in entire packages and get hopelessly drunk on them after two tiny sips.

Nothing to be sorry for,” she says at once, conviction strong in her words. But then she sighs again, smaller, and rubs her eye with the back of her fingers. He watches her do it, and meets her eyes head on when she looks down at him. Exhaustion lingers, all too familiar. “Truthfully, Moony, I don’t mind the quiet.”

He starts spending more and more time in the library, both to avoid his 'friends', and to do research on a few of the things he had heard. He promises to teach himself everything that has been kept from him, no matter how long it took.He did have to be careful to make sure that Dumbledore knew nothing of what he was doing, which was hard with nosy, spying, friends trying to follow him everywhere.

Harry spoke at Malfoy's trial. It wasn't a planned thing, but he had been thinking about it for a while. He'd been thinking about the fear in Malfoy's eyes, how hopeless his situation had been and how he had never stood a chance. Harry wanted to give him one. Sure, maybe he didn't have to try and convince the guy to sign up to be an Auror, but he did. Maybe he didn't have to volunteer to be his partner when no one else would, but he did. He most certainly didn't have to fall in love with the guy, but, well, he did.

Summer in the Burrow is usually a very happy time, but after Cedric’s death in the TriWizard Tournament, and Harry’s claims that he saw He Who Shall Not Be Named, things were tense. We all believed Harry of course, but with that knowledge that he was telling the truth came fear. My parents were halfway across the world at a dig and I couldn’t bear to be home alone, so naturally, I crashed at the Burrow. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley wouldn’t have it any other way, though I do wonder if they would feel that way if they knew what their sons and I had been up to the previous year. Would we ever get back to that happier time? Would I ever find myself writhing in pleasure beneath their sheets?

“N-no. Omega aren’t — they’re not real.” She’s squirming, pressing herself against him as she talks. “They’re a myth.”“You sure, Granger?” His voice is low. He says her name with a slow drawl as he slides his fingers against her dripping knickers. “Did you ever bother to check? Or did you just assume? I have to admit, as a teenage boy, I was curious to find out. Where do you think half-breeds come from?” He leans close enough to whisper. “Did you think being fucked by a troll is something witches volunteer for?”Granger blinks as though the idea hasn’t occurred to her until just then. He steps closer until there’s barely any space between them. She’s rocking her hips rapidly against his hand. Desire pools in his lower abdomen as his cock begins throbbing in time with his pounding heart.

These are a few ideas I've had for stories set partly within the Vorkosigan universe (frequently crossing it with other fandoms in unlikely combinations).  I don't feel able to write most of them, either because I don't know the setting well enough, or because I have the idea of a beginning of a story but don't know where it will end up, so I'd be interested to hear whether anyone else wants to use them.  Some are inspired by other people's fanfics, which I will include links to.  In these cases, it's probably best if you contact the writer of the original to ask them whether they're okay with your writing a fanfic based on theirs.

Albus Dumbledore isn't an idiot. He knows that putting Harry, a virtually untrained schoolchild, up against Voldemort's guerrilla fighters would sign their death warrants. So he turns to his old friend Yukichi Fukuzawa to ask for a favor and drags Severus with him to Yokohama. A week later, Chuuya Nakahara and Osamu Dazai arrive in Britain, ready to kick ass and take names. And try to commit suicide via moving staircase, but that's just Dazai. (Starts the summer before 6th year and at the conclusion of the Guild arc.)---“Well then, Severus,” Albus said, his voice cheerful. “Onwards and upwards?”Severus sneered. “Upwards, Albus?

Harry's 5th year was probably the worst year of his life. First Voldemort happened, then Umbridge, then Voldemort AGAIN, and then Sirius died. Harry doesn't even have the time to properly mourn Sirius before he's shipped back to the Dursley's for the summer. He can't even think straight and with each passing day since losing Sirius, Harry feels more and more exhausted. By the time his 16th birthday rolls around, Uncle Vernon has to literally beat Harry just to wake him up. After a rather brutal beating given to him by his uncle on the eve of his birthday, Harry wakes to find something he had never thought possible. He wakes up to find a long snake tail instead of his legs. A few days later, his family abandons him in some random forest. What a wonderful way to start his 16th year of life after the worst year of his life.* Do not post to another site * Do not translate without permission *

Remus has never had many friends since Hogwarts, a sacrifice he's made to preserve his secret. He's been living in the Muggle world since he was eighteen and has a set schedule, like a middle-aged businessman. When his mum invites (forces) him to attend a  party, dragging him out of his bookshop and encouraging him to finally make some friends, the twenty-one year old comes face to face with an old school mate that might just shake up his carefully planned life.Sirius is bored. He's still adjusting to living without the constant fear of the war and working through his past problems from the Most Abusive and Incestuous House of Black, all while trying to be a good godfather. The number of loose Death Eaters dwindles, along with his work as an Auror, and he misses the thrill. Sirius is worried that the war was the only thing keeping him grounded. But when Lily drags him along to a party, maybe a man he hasn't seen in years can help him start living again.

During her fifth year at Hogwarts, Linda Malfoy (Scorpius Malfoy's twin sister) begins to have terrible unprecedented nightmares followed by the gradual loss of her vision. Her mother provides her  with prescription glasses, but rather than helping her vision they seem to be allowing her to see concealed truths. Meanwhile, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is having private meetings with Iris, concealed as tutoring sessions, to solicit her help with a secret mission. This mission concerns two things: Linda, and the gold serpent ring that has been on her finger her entire life.

Harry Potter manages to teleport himself to Wayne Manor to get away from his abusive uncle after a accidental display of magic. Harry grows up as a bat, trained by a bat and loved by a Daddy Bat, a Cat, a Spoiler, two sister bats and four Robins. This is Harry Potter's journey as a son, brother, a superhero, and a wizard. This is a transformation story from an abused state to healthy relationships. Oh, and I HATE Albus Dumbledore, Lionel Luthor, Arthur Brown, the Dursleys (with the exception of Dudley), Janet and Jack Drake, and Willis Todd.I strongly despise Talia Ah Ghul and Augusta Longbottom.I simply just do NOT like Lois Lane, she's whiny and selfish.

Her youngest was a shy little thing. Nicknamed practically from birth by Bill and Charlie, “Bug” was smaller than any of her others at that age and watched the older boys thoughtfully, never quick to butt into a conversation, preferring to form opinions completely before joining. Once Bug did speak up, though, the other boys were given a run for their money. At only eight, Molly could already tell her youngest was smart, maybe the smartest of her children, though she wouldn’t ever admit that, and Bug’s accidental magic manifestations made Molly think her youngest might also be the most powerful of them all. Really, Bug reminded Molly a lot of herself. Smart, determined, and quietly powerful. She looked forward to what Bug would become.

Sirius and Remus haven't been a couple since they were eighteen. (What happened in the broom cupboard at James and Lily's wedding doesn't count.) Now they've been reunited, but Sirius is well aware he's never been less fanciable - a notorious ex-con moping around Remus's cottage, playing Nick Drake cassettes on repeat, getting into rows with Remus's emotionally manipulative father.While Sirius was in prison, Remus built a new life, one filled with friends and music and activism. His feelings for Sirius haven't changed, but he has no intention of rushing back into a relationship with his ex-boyfriend (or leaving Wales for a mysterious tower in the Scottish Highlands).But the moon has other ideas.

And the last, was probably his favorite. For he had chosen her. She was not outwardly what most people would assume he would want in a follower, but oh how wrong they were. They could not see the potential hidden under frizzy hair and books. He had been swaying her choice subtly. A book on Norse mythology here, a green and gold snake amulet there. His name appearing in places and stories they perhaps shouldn’t. And she was curious, especially now that she knew the magical world was real.

Ginny had danced with Astoria before, but it was nothing like dancing with Astoria now. They were in a world all their own, all smiles and sparkling eyes, floating somewhere far above the rest of the world. Ginny would never understand how she had missed this before, how she had been so oblivious to the way Astoria made her insides flutter and her knees feel like jelly. Astoria was just so good, and maybe that’s what had held Ginny back, too afraid to want someone so beyond comprehension. But somehow, Astoria wanted her too, and the thought kept making all the air leave Ginny’s lungs.---Unapologetically queer, post-war coming-of-age story about queer identity, activism, etc. with a slow-burn Astoria/Ginny romance at its centre. All main protagonists are queer and/or trans. There's queer history, good Slytherins, and close, inter-house friendships.

She can’t remember, exactly, how long she’s been in this windowless room - her gilded cage. The only blessed relief is that her captors, her family, have kept her mealtimes regular so she has been able to mark the passage of the hours, days, weeks she’s been here. And it only seems to be getting worse.

“I’m just . . .” Blaise trails off, realizing he probably doesn’t need to explain to Nott why he’s buying lube. Except—he wants to. He wants to explain to Nott why he’s buying lube. In detail. Graphic detail. Exceptional detail. He wants to demonstrate, wants to show off, wants to outline all the ways he’s uniquely qualified to take care of Nott, all the reasons he’s uniquely capable of taking care of Nott. How he can do it better. Do it best. “Yeah.”

He hadn’t wanted to hear Sirius’s apologies, but he saw them. He noticed them in many places, including, but not limited to, notes flown to his desk and long letters under his pillow. Ambushes in the corridors, away from the prying ears of any students, or in their dormitory, with Prongs and Wormtail suddenly needing to run to the library. Quiet knocking on the frame of his poster bed late at night, or fifteen different flavours of fudge on his bedside table. James and Peter as reluctant messengers. Judging by the intense look of anguish mixed with concentration on Sirius’s face whenever he was near, not that he was trying to look, failed attempts at telepathy.

Prompt given was as follows:Prompt - Ginny Weasley stumbles on Blaise Zabini outside of a graduation party, still clothed in cap and gown, worried about what they're going to do now that Uni is over. Ginny offers distraction/comfort.Kinks - The Slytherin is the one panicking, and the distraction is fueled by sober feelings, despite the party atmosphere. Smut welcome!Squicks - No rape, no character bashing, no slut-shaming.Additional Notes - Surprise me! I'd like to see whatever sort of story is inspired by the closing of one chapter.

Contrary to popular belief, not all of Tony Stark's life is media fodder. There’s actually quite a few things most average people don’t know from the headlines. Even still there’s at least two things that aren’t even in his shield files.  And honestly he’d be more sorry about revealing them if there wasn’t currently a world ending situation going on. After all everyone on this helicarrier knew the gods of old existed. So ya know, needs must and all that. The fact that he was also hoping to make Fury bust a blood vessel was icing on the cake really.

Brilliant, indifferent, thunderous Tom Riddle who was like an explosion happening inside a steel cage. Enigmatic and haunting and probably not worth her time but Florence couldn't look away...It's 1944 and Florence Allman is set to debut to the Wizarding Society of the Southeastern United States in less than a year, which means in less than a year she will be eligible for marriage. Except that she's not ready for that, at least not yet. When her father, a wealthy businessman and plantation owner is offered a deal by the British Ministry of Magic to help fight Gellert Grindelwald, Florence accompanies him from Georgia to England where she is to complete her seventh year of magical education at Hogwarts and experience some of life before it's taken away from her forever. Except that she's woefully behind in her studies, and even worse, there's this boy.

So much time has passed by that Albus wonders if he still means something to Scorpius. Last time they saw each other, ten years ago, they were breaking up. Now Albus is standing in the hospital room and Scorpius is sleeping in the bed in front of him, looking like a fallen angel, and Albus can't find the strength to overcome the distance. It seems like a few more steps but in reality, a decade of life without each other lies between them.In which a curse that separated Albus and Scorpius once reunites them now.

Hermione darted forwards, only to come to a sudden stop. There was a distant figure just beyond the water, on the far side of the cave. Head perked up at what must have been the sound of her footsteps.It was a young, blond man—likely her own age, by the look of it. He was sitting still, hands bound with long chains to the nearby floor. His clothes were worn out and rotten, their style older than anything she had seen even Purebloods in England wear. A geometric pattern too faded to fully recognise stood out on the coat’s breast pocket. His hair fell neatly just above his shoulders despite it. Skin, though caked with dirt and grime, smooth and unblemished.(In which, five years after the war, Hermione meets Gellert Grindelwald whilst searching for something that will cure her parents)

Charles Weasley never decided on marrying, but by just looking at the shivering girl, he knew he had to rescue her. Padma Patil knew of him only by his name, she had never seen him in person. But his red hair, his gentle face, and soulful eyes helped her to agree to the ridiculous offer, "" only marriage can keep her safe from Greyback and his vicious werewolves.""The Battle of Hogwarts just killed one Evil, while another was preparing to strike. Half of Magical Britain is wiped off, and those who remain must join together. The ministry brings out a Magical Marriage Law in an effort to protect those marked by Greyback, who will stop at nothing to eliminate wizards and establish the rule of Werewolves. Black Lotus is a spin-off. Though I plan to get these two characters involved in the main plot at a later date.

Rey Skywalker is a Seventh Year student at Hogwarts. Ben Solo is her teacher. Her favorite teacher, actually. Her best friends Poe and Finn think that she has a crush on him. And that it's mutual. She thinks they probably got hit too hard on the head by a bludger (which is weird, cause Finn has no idea how to fly). Ben Solo is a great teacher. He is doing what he is the best at and students love him. In his first year teaching at Hogwarts, he finds himself fascinated by one of his students. He is a decent man who knows that teacher-student relationships are forbidden in Hogwarts, so he keeps his distance, but Rey is about to graduate, so he can finally take his chances...

Prompt: (via FF.net) Regarding your prompt requests, I will boldly request something way out there, because I LOVE your talent at making rare pairs work/come alive. How about a never-before-seen rare pair of Hermione Granger and Florean Fortescue; very squicky post-Hogwarts — she likes to indulge in the occasional special delivery to her office, and he likes her flavour?

They’ve kissed before—fleeting snatches of romantic moments away from the prying eyes of the castle’s many occupants—but today is a new day, a magical day. Today will see the dawn of a new period in their lives: Harry will become his betrothed as well as his beloved. “Soon,” Harry says eventually, when the racing of his heart has slowed to an unremarkable pace. “I want today’s first kiss to be when you wake me from slumber.”Or: Tom Riddle is the love of Harry Potter's life. All he needs to do is wake Harry with a kiss.

Depression. The word was foreign in my mouth. I didn’t have depression. I had a lovely childhood with lots of friends and a loving family. But the quotes on Pinterest about depression and anxiety were so alluring. While I did have extreme social anxiety to the point where I could barely open my mouth in public without a raspy voice, I was not depressed. But I wanted to be. I wanted to be set apart from others, to be different. I would consistently look up ‘depression quotes’ or ‘anxiety quotes’ on Pinterest in hopes to fall into a slump by reading the mood-killing sentences.

Set in a world where all magic folk have soulmarks, each one representing the thing their soulmate is most passionate about. Upon one's soulmate seeing the mark, it becomes full color and completes the soulmate bond, binding two witches' and wizards' powers and creating a strong connection. During the Hogwarts year 1997-1998, Neville Longbottom finds himself doing what he can to resist the dark powers that have forced themselves onto the school. In doing so though, the untimely finding of his soulmate sets him back. What would usually be a joyous occasion especially for a young wizard of his age, is overshadowed by the current events in the world. What's more though is that his soulmate, Arthur McCross, is a Slytherin, one from a group filled with the worst of the worst. Will Neville get past the many preconceived notions he has about Arthur and see the good in him, if there's any at all? And will Arthur break away from fate and learn that the things you love are truly worth standing up for? Only time spent at the hellish year of Hogwarts will tell.

I was never really that happy with the Epilogue, it seemed to be a ""happily ever after"" type scenario in only the most conventional terms, none of the characters ever really expressed any desire to get married and have terribly named children.
Plus JK stated after publication that Harry, Ron and Hermione went to work at the Ministry despite them spending the latter half of the series working against the Ministry and learning how easily it can be corrupted. So I changed it completely in this to give them an ending with a bit more urgancy, and that actually makes sense.
I think Harry Potter belongs more to the fans than to J.K. Rowling at this point, if she's more concerned with appeasing her transphobic followers, then the wizarding world should be claimed by the people who actually learned kindness and tolerance from the series, I'd love to see everyone start ammending and adjusting parts of the books they feel aren't as great as they cud have been, and ACTUALLY insert characters from marginalized backgrounds into the actual text.
Please forgive the punctuation/grammatical nightmare, it's been a ong time since i wrote anything so i'm a bit rusty.

When all the death eaters broke out of Azkaban, they woke a certain prisoner who has been in there for a very long time. Practically as long as the prison has been built, maybe even longer. Was he put there because he committed some atrocious crime? No, nothing so dark and dreary. Immortality to some seems like a blessing; some people strive for it, kill for it even. But some see it as a curse of an endless life. Some people wish they were just normal human beings. Living a 100-year lifespan. Maybe even the wizarding 200-year lifespan but no more. One man wishes for death. But could never grasp it. Until he meets the master of it. Or at least the soon to be master.Coming into a new world with Dark Lords and young children fighting in a war, they need not fight. An old sorcerer joins the battle.(Currently editing)

After the war, Hermione Granger goes on a separate way from her best friends, who both train to become Auros, and return to Hogwarts alone to help rebuilt the castle. It is now her only home, but Hogwarts and it's people are still full of secrets, some of them ready to be shared...while other are waiting to be created. With Severus Snape still in a magical coma after barely surviving Nagini's bite, McGonagall assuming the Headmistress role permanently and Albus' portrait understanding that he could stop meddling with people so much, many things had changed... And for once in her scholarly path, Hermione is unprepared for the turn of event: the room of requirement require her…just as someone else from the past does to access a brighter future. They just don't know it.

Potter defends people, he throws himself into things with moronic Gryffindor bravery, and Draco doesn’t have the heart (what does he have the heart for, he wonders) to tell him that he could save so many more people if he applied a dab of Slytherin cunning to his schemes and machinations. 
 
 But everyone has always hated Slytherins, the whole school hates him and Pansy and Millie and Blaise and Crabbe and Goyle and the rest of them, green-clothed smirking daggers that they are.  
 
 Draco doesn’t bother to explain that Slytherin takes in the battered ones, the one that life has crushed, and sharpens them all into something wicked and strong.  He doesn’t bother to explain that they are cruel but they are kind, that the volley of clever wordplay is fun, sometimes.  Yes, they are sharp and cruel, but they do nothing the world hasn’t done to them already, and people are so fucking hypocritical.
 
He doesn’t have the heart to.

Tom Riddle’s reputation in the Wizarding World is this: ambitious, intelligent, powerful, and undoubtedly the next Minister for Magic - if only he would quit his job at Borgin and Burkes. His intentions fool everyone but Hermione Granger.When their paths cross in 1948 due to a business deal and a cursed necklace, Tom and Hermione find themselves the friendliest of enemies. Temptation has many faces, but to Hermione, Tom Riddle’s is the most irresistible.  ""I once told you that power always wins. There is no good or evil, Hermione. It is a fine line. Do you see that now?"" Hermione stared indifferently down to the man writhing in pain at her feet. She twirled her wand carelessly in her fingers as she replied, ""I do.""  Tom smirked and tucked a curl behind her ear, his fingers stained in blood. ""Good girl.""~ This story uses characters from, but is not affiliated with, JK Rowling and the Harry Potter series. Warning: dark themes (some graphic), sexual content, language, and slow-burn. This is also an AU, in which Hermione Granger is a pure-blooded witch living in Tom Riddle’s original timeline.

He was completely sure that this would turn out to be the biggest mistake of his brother’s life—their relationship was rocky, but Ron was certain that Draco could never be worthy of his brother.

They’ve been quarantined in their flat for twelve days now, but with the way things are carrying on outside, it is looking like this could possibly last months. Remus, the introvert, is just now beginning to feel the effects of being sequestered away from the world, but Sirius started going stir-crazy around day four. But, they’ve managed to keep one another distracted with different activities: baking together, catching up with their ever growing Netflix queue, reading out loud to each other, and plenty of frisky romps in the sack followed by sweaty and sticky cuddling.

A Family Tree, he discovers, where he is surprised to note two half-sisters, one by the name Petunia and the other Lily. After discovering they both have, or had in Lily's case, family. Boris wanted to learn more about this side of the family and if they were just as crazy as the ones he knows. In any case, it was best to let them know about the illness on the male side of the family, having no doubt his father might've passed it to his half-siblings and their male children. Of course, that was until he discovered one Harry Potter, his nephew, was not...treated well.This is Harry's story of living in America with his new uncle and the drama that seems to unfold.Will be set around Season 3 of Royal Pains

It's odd, really, that they all have the same tradition. With Malfoy, it's probably some rich person thing or other, a whim passed down through his sicko semi-fascist family. Makes sense.But with Harry, Luna and Hermione, it's almost pure coincidence. Harry comes to the bonfire despite knowing nobody there, because he celebrates the winter solstice for... for his own reasons. Hermione goes because Lavender forced her into it. Luna goes because Ginny went, and because the fire is pretty.Coincidence. The cogs of fate turning in a way that seems random at best.Luna doesn't believe in coincidence. Draco thinks Luna is crazy. Hermione thinks coincidence is just a part of life.But Harry can't help but wonder... could coincidence just be another word for destiny?

Death gives Harry a 'chance to make it better' and Harry, naive boy that he still is, decides not to further investigate what Death really means.

He seizes the opportunity with a small promise hidden in the back of his mind. When he dies again, Death is going to hear a piece of his mind.

Annan Peredhel is an enby elf whose burgeoning wizard magic has finally outgrown their elven masters instruction. Sent to Hogwarts for schooling Annan is worried about finding their place between worlds when they run into a childhood friend, Minerva McGonagall. Less has changed for Annan than McGonagall, now an adult and a Professor at Hogwarts, and the two must grapple with old feelings never-spoken and new dynamics.  To make matters worse Annan sees the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor fraternizing with an infamously Dark wizard and is thrown into a plot that will require them to risk life and limb for a world they barely know. The Prisoner of Azkaban but from a totally different perspective. Luna and Cho are aged up to 18, repeating a year after being petrified by the basilik. Their younger siblings will take their place in the OG plot line.

There are parts of his past, parts of himself that he would like to cut out. Only when they are removed, Draco Malfoy is sure, he can feel whole again. He had meant to start over, not end up in St. Mungo's psychiatric ward where he realises that the road to redemption is not an easy one, especially not when Dark Magic is still lurking around every corner. In his fight against his own past and new enemies, hope can appear in the strangest shapes and sizes, and sometimes, in the form of an annoyingly persistent healer named Astoria Greengrass.

Is this story a little oddball of a head canon? Yep. But as quarantine drags itself out to the bitter end, do you honestly have something better to do than read it?So buckle-up buttercup, we're diving off the non-canon deep end. What if The Cursed Child wasn't annoying as hell? What if Draco Malfoy had a daughter instead of a son? What if Libra Malfoy was the greatest witch of her age and the world wanted to burn her alive for it? What if she and Albus Potter joined forces and decided to repay the favor?If canon is the hill you want to die on, may I suggest looking elsewhere. If you happen to be tired of Rowling macerating the legacy of the original books, well then, read on. There will drama. There will be angst. There will be gays (gasp). There will be a love for magic, wild and unbridled. I don't know about you, but I'm ready to go back to Hogwarts.

The light from the full moon filtered through a gap in the curtains and Remus stirred slightly, not waking from his slumber. Outside the window, there was the sound of howling, but Remus didn’t wake.

He didn’t wake until there was the sound of fragmenting and the window crashed inwards. Remus is only four-years-old when he is bitten by a werewolf.

After a miserable ending to an otherwise magical first year at Hogwarts, Harry Potter wants nothing more than to escape the clutches of his muggle relatives once more and return to the world in which he belongs. His brother Charlus, the Boy-Who-Lived, wants nothing more than to redeem his own failures and prove to not just the wizarding world, but to himself as well that he is more than just some child celebrity.Unbeknownst to Harry and Charlus, the two of them will have to struggle with more than their own personal demons. There is a monster roaming the halls of Hogwarts, one controlled by an equally mysterious Heir of Slytherin, one who is seemingly hell-bent on destroying Hogwarts from the inside out. How will the Potter twins react to threats from this Heir of Slytherin, along with their own personal struggles, both internal and external? And what of the enigmatic Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor who seems to be far more than what meets the eye?

When Severus Snape banked on being dead at the end of a war, it was as much of a shock as a burden to find out he was very much alive. He'd rather welcome oblivion and be known as a hero, than watch himself become a listless ghost of his former self. He never expected his Life After Death would contain much but living an isolated, quiet, life. Instead he somehow ended up returning to Hogwarts to teach, becoming involved in student affairs he'd rather stay far removed from, and most importantly, having copious amounts of sex with his old childhood enemy- Remus Lupin. Recovery is a fickle and long road, and he certainly didn't expect his would involve accepting Remus as part of it.(Now being translated into Korean by the lovely and dedicated Jagabee:https://archiveofourown.org/works/29211414 )

Hermione Granger is the most brilliant witch of her age.  This may be why she is arrogant enough to mess with time.  Hermione accidentally travels back to Tom's final year at Hogwarts, and on her trip home has a bit of a stowaway.  As if one Tom Riddle wasn't hard enough to handle, they seem to be popping up at her everywhere she turns.  As Hermione is sucked more deeply into Lord Voldemort's plots, she doesn't know if she will ever escape.

Who said travelling into a book means you have to go on ridiculous adventures and save everyone? This is a fanfiction about a girl travelling to the Harry Potter world and decided to wreak havoc. In which memes are referenced, logic is disregarded, and wizards (and witches) are confused.(Would recommend reading alongside the book. Believe me it's funnier that way.)We have a discord server~ Come and scream at me!Cross posted on FFNNOW WITH ANIMATICS and art at the last chapter

Sirius is trapped behind the Veil for what seems like years on his end, minutes on the other side. He is not alone, however, but trapped with Leta LeStrange, who entered the purgatorial realm when Grindelwald seemingly incinerated her. Together, Leta and Sirius come to terms with their past, and make it back from beyond the Veil, just in time to join the war against Voldemort as it begins in earnest. Meanwhile, Remus and Nymphadora Tonks overcome a misunderstanding, and Harry and Ginny Weasley become close as they investigate a Black family secret.

Potter must have been having nightmares again. He was restless in his bed across the room. Moonlight shone through his open bed curtains and highlighted the contours of his body, the grimace on his face blatant. His thick blanket was kicked down, one leg still covered by his twisted sheet, the musk of his sweat pungent in their small dorm. Low grunts accounted for the majority of the noise he made, but it was peppered by the occasional groan or unclear shout of words. However, ‘No,’ was always clear. Draco hated it.

Escorting trouble-making students back to their dorms and breaking up midnight duels and secret lovers gets old after the first few times they do it; quidditch, on the other hand, never gets old. Nor does winning against Marcus. Katie blames it on the fact that she spent two years at Hogwarts trying to entice a bludger in his direction whenever she wasn’t chasing the quaffle. It gave her a lifelong satisfaction in winning games against Marcus Flint, even now when they’re a quidditch instructor and a Muggle Studies professor rather than Slytherin and Gryffindor chasers.

The conclusion of the AO3 work Sarcasm and Slytherin. Chapters 1-16 are available here. https://archiveofourown.org/works/15848610/chapters/36912186This is Sunmoonandstars, back from the dead. Original work summary:  Harry Potter returns for his fifth year at Hogwarts amidst an increasingly unstable political situation. And this year, for the first time, Hogwarts is no longer firmly under Albus Dumbledore's control. Threats inside and outside the school put pressure on some of Harry's closest friendships, and power struggles lie beneath the surface of every faction in the brewing conflict. At its center is the Potter family, and Harry's position is more critical, and more precarious, than ever.Happy reading everyone. I have no clue when book 6 is going to be done or ready to post but have at least the end of book 5 because it's been languishing on my hard drive for too long.

Running one of the biggest Mafia bands in the city, Harry Potter aka Harold Padfoot, is quite stressed, when his second in command advises him to get laid.  Mostly just pure smut. I might add one more chapter later on though.

""“Er, I’m fine, thanks. By any chance, are you aware that there’s a dragon living in your suitcase?” Harry asked, still somewhat baffled.
“Well, are you aware there’s an owl perched on your shoulder?” The other boy said, and inclined his chin in Hedwig’s direction. Harry laughed at that.
“That’s Hedwig—she’s my friend,” he replied, and stroked her soft head.
The other boy looked on in clear approval. He seemed to like animals as much as Harry did. He wondered if they could be friends.""-
Newt was, perhaps, the strangest, most unconventional person Harry had ever known. He loved him for it. He would follow him wherever he went, even to the far reaches of the known wizarding world. Newt was his first friend. That meant something to Harry, who had grown up unloved and alone. He'd make sure Newt never felt the same—no matter what.

He's on the edge of something, though he doesn't know what it is yet. But there's a choice before him, one he almost doesn't want to make.Draco's been the potions master at Hogwarts for four years. At the beginning of his fifth year, everything looks like it'll be smooth sailing. That is, until the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher arrives and throws all of Draco's well-considered plans out the window.

“You know Professor Lupin was a werewolf?” Hermione said, ten minutes into a very awkward lunch she had asked for in an equally awkward letter.
Lavender pushed a sauteed carrot through a little puddle of pasta sauce. “I think everyone heard about that one. Someone told the papers, or something, right?”
“Er, yes,” said Hermione. “Snape did. Which is what I– I mean, it’s related. Oh, I wish you’d gotten to talk to Remus about this. He was a lovely man.”
“Not as lovely as Lockhart,” Lavender said and she and Hermione spent a moment in wistful remembrance. “God, I feel old,” Lavender said.
“Anyway, Snape,” said Hermione. “Snape and Lupin. When Lupin was at school, Snape would make him a potion that would… tame him, on full moons. He could just curl up in his office and sleep by the fire. If you’re interested, I’m trying to learn how to brew it myself.”
Lavender shook her head. “We’re not friends,” she said. “Never have been. So why are you doing all this?”
Hermione looked like she was trying to say “we’re friends,” but she couldn’t get it out.

We all know the story of 'The Boy Who Lived'. Every child knows his name. Everyone loves the tale of how Harry Potter saved the Wizarding World from Voldemort.But do we know the story of 'The Greatest Sorcerer Ever To Walk The Earth'? Every time Ron cried, ""Merlin's beard!"", did we stop to wonder who exactly Merlin was, and what he had done to be recognized worldwide and have an order named after him?
This is the story of a young boy, who thought that he was a nobody, growing into a man, who would be remembered for centuries.

Hermione returns to Hogwarts for her 'eighth' year without Harry and Ron, with the horrors of the war still fresh in her mind, but determined to start anew. Malfoy seems subdued, altered by the events of the past year or so, though he's not without his acerbic tongue. Assigned Theodore Nott as her patrol partner for their prefect duties, she finally has the time to get to know the two Slytherins, and discovers that there's a whole lot more to them than the prejudice of their past and the snake on their house badge. Slow-burn Draco x Theo x Hermione, endgame happy trio with lots of fluff and smut.*Sporadic updates! Be warned...*

At all. Especially after she found out that she was betrothed to a boot-licking Martian! And the worst part is, the Martian she needs to marry is none other than Draco Malfoy, the only son of Voldemort’s third-in-command. Oh, how will she ever survive this ordeal?

The Dark Lord was successful in killing Harry Potter, and the wizarding world has suffered under the new reigns of his unforgiving band of Death Eaters. The Order has since been hunted down and marked as enemies of the new political state. The Canary is a notorious member of the resistance and is wanted for relaying crucial information about the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters. As such, there is a steep reward for whomever manages to seize this faceless, nameless war criminal. Seize is not exactly the word Draco Malfoy would use to describe how the interaction went, but hey, he didn't expect to discover who the Canary really was… and he certainly didn't expect to fall in love with her either. Canon-compliant until Battle of Hogwarts.

Where there is a handsome and noble prince, there is an innocent and benevolent maiden whom requires rescuing from a curse bestowed upon her. It is also true that where there is power, there is a man prepared to seize it at any cost. This story has many elements (twisted fairytale, soulmates, historical fantasy, etc) but it does take place in an AU where Potterverse magic exists and is quite a dark read.

With the war finally over, you’d think Harry would finally be granted that “normal life” he’s always dreamt about. Finally free from the Dursleys, from that nose-less megalomaniac, from Horcruxes, Hollows, Death Eaters, Dementors, Prophecies… you’d think that he, for the first time in his life, would be allowed to be just a normal teenager. You’d think he’d deserve that much, right?But then you haven’t considered Luna Lovegood. Luna, who has the most whimsical ideas that no one ever takes seriously. Luna, who apparently has Swedish heritage and knows about some strange Summer Solstice ritual that she wants to perform. Luna, who’s so sweet and kind that you can’t help but humour her when she offers you some distraction from your post-war confusion.Harry knows he should’ve known better, knows he shouldn’t have let her persuade him to go through with it. But he did.And now, Harry’s life will probably never be normal again.

That, he hopes, will never be known to anyone.For week one of @girlwithacrown's hppridemonth! Already posted on tumblr and Instagram, but I'm putting it here, too. :)

Lyra Potter had known for a long while that Sirius Black was a little more than her Godfather, and James Potter a little less. It never really meant much to her. Yet, when both men die on the same day in a freak accident, and a strange man turns up at the funeral calling himself uncle, Lyra finally knew what Sirius meant when he told her sometimes you needed to do something bad to stop yourself from doing something worse.

titled inspired by the quote: ""Never saw one without the other, did you?... Quite the double act, Sirius Black and James Potter!"" AU where Remus and Sirius decide they want to have a child of their own after hearing about Lily's pregnancy. Marlene is a willing surrogate, and nine months later, both children are both born. They grow up together for a short amount of time, but then the Potters are betrayed and Remus is left alone to raise their child. basically if you want to re-read the books but also want wolfstar lol. will be diverging from canon on several key points. (Sirius and Remus both live, Harry will move in with Remus and Sirius after year three)This is a rewrite. I've changed canonical quotes to fit my own story. If I come across something JKR had a character say that was problematic, I'll erase it. But I won't ignore valid character flaws. *not a fan of JKR or her disgusting views. there will be lots of LGBTQIA representation in this fic.*https://open.spotify.com/playlist/14miu9hjun1f1vdKSPcrsO?si=t2yxPsvkR0m5TVIgVwQ_Zw&dl_branch=1

Severus Snape has never been a religious man, he didn’t believe in many things, but he did believe that things could be built and fixed – relationships included. So, when Severus had made his way into Remus’s office to give him his wolf’s bane potion as usual that belief was shaken, he looked around the room in hope the wolf was playing a prank as he made his way towards the desk.

Hermione is a kindred spirit, she believes everyone can change, she believes that there is goodnes in almost every person. Everyone knows this. This is the reason why all of her friends believe she decided to testify in favor of Lucius, Narcissa and Draco Malfoy.But what if the reason she decided to testify was because she felt more connected to the circusntances of their case because she is one of the few of the Light side that understood the reasons behind their alliance with the Dark Lord and wanted to give them the opportunity to change their ways. Even if Lucius and Draco are still being assholes.A Malfoy ball may be the perfect opportunity to unite purebloods with Muggleborns and Half Bloods, and also may be the door to discovering that Hermione´s lifestyle may have more similarities with that one of a pureblood.

He was only looking for a safe place to escape his bullies, he didn't expect to find himself in a desert town...in America.A desert town where the sun is hot, the moon is beautiful, and where a little boy who was taught he was a freak, may have just found a place where he isn't. And in this place, he found a home. [[Starts between e27 First Date and e28 Summer Reading Program, July 2013. Time is weird in Night Vale, so yes, Harry technically time travels to the future.]]

I’m just waiting for you to act on it.” She shot him an amorous look, which quickly got replaced by a troubled one.

Severus Snape may have escaped Azkaban, but he does not go throughout life unencumbered. Despite his desire to attempt to forge an ordinary life, he must struggle against the obstacles presented by his unique situation. First his recently re-animated feud with James Potter; then, both Dumbledore and the Ministry doing their best to keep their leashes tight and - perhaps most concerningly - he now has a devoted fan, and one that is doing their best to imitate some of his deadliest potions. As the goals of his copycat become clearer, Severus' newly shaped moral principles will truly be put to the test.

Draco found himself waiting for Hermione to pull away.Any second now she’d do it. She’d go still in his arms, then tug back from him, looking shaken or even alarmed, and she’d say, what are we doing, or maybe what am I doing, and he’d be forced to consider the questions himself. And then she’d spiral into descriptions of the short-term and long-term consequences, probably structured like an argumentative essay which, written down, would have filled three feet of parchment.Minutes passed, though, and she didn’t go still.---a Disappearances outtake that happens between chapters sixteen and seventeen. it's literally just kissing. thank you for your time

Harry Potter, but not as you remember.For as long as he can remember, Harry Potter has lived in a cupboard under the stairs at Number 4 Privet Drive. As his 11th birthday approaches, someone seems very determined to send him a letter - and his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon seem just as determined to make sure he never reads it. But what could a letter say that's so important? And why can Harry do things that no one else can?this is fueled completely by my hatred on JK Rowling.

What if Remus didn't keep his relationship to Harry's parents a secret throughout third year. What if from the first time he saw him after driving away the dementors he decided to tell Harry the truth. Remus makes a decision and the bond between Harry and him grows. Trust and love lead to a very different third year for Harry Potter, and that makes all the difference.Remus watches as Harry stirs and when those green eyes meet his something jolts in his mind. A longing so strong overwhelms him, a yearning for his family. How he hates how cautiously those eyes look at him, like a stranger.I used to be Uncle Moony and he used to be my cub.2/12/22: On Hiatus, Sorry all life's been a bit busy, hope I can return to this eventually.

Hermione Granger took a sip of her tea, long since bitter on her tongue and she stared down at the Daily Prophet's front page, sensational news splashed across the front page in black and white. Mr. and Mrs. Brown stared up at her balefully as the Wizengamot debated in colorless fervor. 'WAR HERO POTTER FAILS IN BID TO KEEP GREYBACK IN AZKABAN', drifted across the page, looping and swirling in between the smaller text as the photograph looped again and again, Mrs. Brown burying her face into a handkerchief as the verdict rang out. Hermione scoffed, and, with a quick flick of her wand, watched as the paper went up in flames. _

Ah yes, third year. The year that has the least to do with Voldemort yet so much happens. Too bad for Hogwarts they have a reckless Slytherin who is getting tired of taking baby steps. Slow and steady may win the race, but there's nothing wrong with taking a few shortcuts. What's the worst that could happen? Besides, if Hogwarts won't actively give Harry a normal year, he'll make one for himself.

'Now more than ever do we need our friends by our side.'A war is waging outside Hogwarts, students are getting the Dark Mark, and muggleborns are targeted more than ever within the castle. Sixth year muggleborn Gracie Parker already has enough on her plate with NEWT-level classes, Quidditch, ballet, and a boyfriend that keeps pulling away, without being cornered by pureblood maniacs at every opportunity. Welcome to the real world. It's not much, but I swear it's sweet.

The Hufflepuff common room had many advantages, the main one being that it was always warm, and this was what had allowed for me and Kim to curl on one of the sofas, each with a book in hand, as we tested each other on the various potions that would be in the upcoming 5th year potions test. “come on y/n, you know this one, Slughorn is making us do it next lesson,” I shot her a dark look, as she fiddled with a strand of her grey hair, “you know I don’t pay a word of attention to anything that man says,” I mumbled flicking through the textbook once more. “well you should,” she teased, “he’s very intelligent, when he’s trying,” I scoffed quietly, “he has a framed picture of every slug club he ever hosted, including one with you know who, he is odious.” Grumbling several curse words, I stretched, and reached for a different textbook, “have you got rounds tonight?” she asked, as I tied my hair into a bun, spearing it in place with a disused quill.

My uncle didn’t believe I could pick my way through the lock.” At this point he smirks, “with this,” he holds up a hairpin triumphantly. Harry feels his eyes go wide “Are you sure that’s  not magic?” He laughs breathlessly at this odd boy, who look at him and not away like everyone else at school who sees Harry being chased by Dudley’s gang and leaps out of their path. This boy who doesn’t wrinkle his nose at Harry’s oversized, worn sweaters. Who unlock doors with hairpins and see strange things happening around Harry (possibly the strangest thing that has happened yet) and grins.

There are 3 all powerful objects used to escape Death. These objects were gifted to humanity.One was a wand, a wand so powerful that it could defeat any enemy in its path. The trail of bodies it left in its wake gave it the title Death Stick. Another was a stone, one that could bring back the dead. Not just a reanimation of the bodies, but fully interacting souls. This brought it the title of Resurrection Stone.  The last was a cloak, one that can be used to hide from anyone and anything even, and most importantly, Death. This one was dubbed the Invisibility cloak. These three powerful objects brought about pain, joy, death, and solace. They were used in evil schemes and good. However what most do not know is that these three things were alive. [ 100+ drabbles of the Deathly Hallows. ]

Okay, so…Draco Malfoy has a thing for Harry Potter. Honestly, how could he not?When Harry invites him to be his ""date"" to his friends' wedding, Draco goes all-in on a soul-bearing display of his real feelings for the man. Once it becomes obvious that he misinterpreted Harry's intentions, Draco begins to feel like all hope has been lost on his Chosen One ever returning those feelings. Through the magic of the Summer Solstice (and perhaps a bit too much wine), he finally finds the courage to take his shot.

As rain lashed against the window pane, Hermione carried two mugs of tea over to the window seat. She took a moment to regard her companion before she handed one of the drinks to George without a word, and his lips quirked into the smallest of smiles; a silent thanks as he shifted his long legs to make room for her. When they were younger, Hermione had never really know what to make of the Weasley twins, but now George was a broken half of a whole, they'd somehow fallen into a surprisingly easy friendship that no-one would have predicted, least of all her.

The War is over and everything has changed.After a few of years of travelling around the world, Harry decided to move to Muggle London, looking for peace and a place where the scar on his forehead doesn’t have a meaning. His new flat is in a perfectly normal neighbourhood close to the centre, quiet during the day but full of students at night. He really likes the small bar down the road, a place that serves cheap, awful drinks and plays good old classics. It’s always crammed with people talking, laughing or dancing along with the riff of electric guitars.From the first time he crossed the threshold, Harry thought it was perfect, the right mix of noise and warmth to be alone without feeling alone. Just what he needed. He couldn’t imagine that someone else was there for the very same reason, looking for a place where the Dark Mark was only a tattoo.Blame it on the alcohol, on the music or whatever you want, but when Harry’s eyes landed on Draco’s slim figure, swaying on the dancefloor, something warm and inexplicable possessed him.

It was a man at the door, and he walked in with an odd mixture of extreme self assurance and that same social fear she'd shown, herself, only a moment ago. His hair was black and stringy, looking clean but not altogether cared for, like parts of it had been burnt or cut away with a blunt knife. His face was young, like hers, but incredibly worn, like he'd been driven to exhaustion a few too many times. The suit he wore was nice, expensive, definitely, but draped over his nearly skeletal form like he'd never even consulted a tailor.He took off his hat, grey to match his coat, and held it against his chest. ""Hey, Hermione, do you mind if I talk to you for a bit? I just need some advice.""Stunned, she gestured an arm, stepping back to allow him into the library proper, instead of just the doorway.

Following the war, the Hogwarts staff decides it’s a good idea to require the eighth-year students to put on a play for a Summer Solstice celebration. Harry may be oblivious, but eventually, not even he can ignore the signs of his and Draco’s sexual tension. It only takes Shakespeare and some skimpy festival costumes to get him to make his move.

Sirius Black was more than the not-so-secret-keeper of Lilly and James Potter. He was a friend. He was a confidant. And, well, this may seem ironic but he was, in fact, a secret keeper. He had kept Lily Potter's biggest secret from even his best friend. But not, well, now things were different. Harry Potter was in grave danger in England and even Dumbledore couldn't keep him safe, which the headmaster had proven when he had allowed Harry Potter to be dragged away to resurrect the Dark Lord. So yeah, sometimes desperate times call for desperate measures. But sending Harry Potter to New York City to meet his actual father? Might be a little bonkers.

As someone who worked with magical artifacts, Hermione knew better than to touch unknown objects with her bare hands. But when her cat leaves her no other choice, Hermione finds herself portkeyed to a magical island - along with someone she might just throttle with those same bare hands if he keeps annoying her. That is, of course, if she doesn’t succumb to his charms first…

Harry's been in self-exile for nearly a decade. A series of betrayals and sacrifices and terrible losses has made him an outcast to the magical world and a stranger to the muggle one. Aimless and struggling to survive, he befriends a green monster on the slopes of the Western Ghats and years later gets drawn in the type of adventuring that torn him apart many years ago. 
But kindness and teamwork and the type of understanding that come from being a monstrous kind of hero pulls Harry deeper and deeper into a family he never asked for. 
The world is changing. Threats from the Ministry of Magic and from SHIELD create a thin line for Harry to straddle to protect his dear friends. And all the while, something comes, searching for the cornerstones of existence, to control and destroy the universe.
Harry remains, as always, tied to Death and Destiny. A martyr? A magician? A madman? Or a master of the deathly hallows?

After the war, Draco is recruited into the Department of Love (aka Cupid's Arrow). His job is to bring together witches and wizards whose magical signatures are only compatible with each others' (essentially soulmates). As they all learned during training, Cupids are chosen because they do not have soulmates.
Six years later, Draco's convinced himself that he's perfectly fine with not having a soulmate. But his latest client turns out to be Harry Potter, and he's forced to reconsider in light of his old feelings.

“Oh - uh - good morning, Malfoy,” stammers Harry, who immediately kicks himself mentally, because that was horrible. Was he twelve again? One word from his crush and he’s reduced to a stuttering mess.

Harry prepares himself for another year at Hogwarts. Under Dumbledore’s orders, Snape and Harry must work together to teach the newly reformed DA. It’s a battle of wills that the students, and teachers, are curious to see. While piecing together a way to defeat Voldemort, Harry can’t help but notice that there’s something Dumbledore isn’t telling him. Will he ever find out the secrets hiding behind closed curtains? And will he and Snape ever come to an understanding?

Raised by his doting Muggle grandparents, Tom Riddle grows up hating purebloods, not Muggles. Still as vicious and sociopathic as ever, he is determined to stage a violent insurrection against pureblood supremacy. As he rises to power in Slytherin, he recruits every disenfranchised Muggleborn and halfblood against the purebloods that have traditionally controlled his house.After opening the Chamber of Secrets, Tom organises his followers into a covert revolutionary vanguard known only as the Chosen. Delving into the Dark Arts, Tom searches not for horcruxes but for disturbing new ways of devouring the magic of purebloods, adding it to his own. He will use any means necessary to eradicate what he believes is a drain on magic itself—pureblood society’s obsession with blood purity.Then, in Tom’s sixth year, a powerful halfblood named Harry Haywood appears at Hogwarts and seems to hate Tom on sight, even though they both agree that purebloods like Grindelwald are dangerous maniacs who should be stopped.Mystified and intrigued by this potential new ally, Tom seeks to recruit Harry into the Chosen, but things don’t go exactly as planned...

Remus didn’t want to be stereotypical.I mean, he didn’t even fit his stereotype.He didn’t cuff his jeans, and he most definitely didn’t listen to Sweater Weather by The Neighborhood.But this man, this one sitting right at table 12, he had tattoos up his arms and too many earrings in one ear. He had three rings on one hand that he twirled non-stop. He wore a cropped long sleeve sweatshirt that he obviously cut himself, biker boots, and tight jeans. Not that Remus had been looking at his jeans. Obviously.

Harry Potter, of all people, knows that life isn’t always fair. And no one gets to be happy all of the time. But surely there’s something more—something better—than a rubbish Ministry job, and a lonely old house, and that feeling that everyone out there is doing a better job of living than Harry is.
And it really doesn’t seem fair that Draco Malfoy is back in Harry’s life, all of a sudden, and even though he’s wandless, and living with Muggles, and making his mother cry with his lifestyle choices, he’s happy. So what's he doing right, that Harry isn’t? 
Because things don’t really change, do they? And if Harry can’t be happy, he’ll settle for a good night’s sleep, some posh antiques, and the opportunity to find out what Malfoy has been up to for all these years.
And that’s what starts it all.

Ambition, the desire to be better than you are, is only ever as good as its cause. Motivated by pride, selfishly seeking power for one's own personal gain is a dangerous game considered evil more often than it's considered good. But it isn't inherently evil. After all, if you're at the bottom, where else do you have to go but up? And why should you help those that pushed you down there on your climb up?
Dillion Lux had just wanted to expand his skills, to learn something not often mastered. There was no ulterior intent beyond a desire to learn for his own personal gain. But, apparently, even just studying the dark arts tainted him. In a second, after one small slip up, Dillion Lux lost everything.
Tom Riddle has always had nothing. The only thing that's ever been his is his own power, the one that kept him safe when he had to defend himself against the muggle bullies. So it should be reasonable that he would want to grow it, that he would want to have it all. But it is not.
The Dark Arts aren't inherently evil, just as Tom and Dillion aren't. But it's hard to remember that when everyone around them seems to think the opposite.

The announcement of the Triwizard tournament had sent Beauxbatons into a hub of excited whispers, and it was these same excited whispers that had hummed on in the background as we travelled via carriage to Hogwarts. “did Viktor enter?” Fleur asked from beside me, her blonde hair had been curled to perfection, and unlike me, she actually seemed excited about the beginning of the tournament, “yes he did,” I murmured quietly, wringing my hands in my lap. It was bad enough that Durmstrang had stopped taking female students the year before we were set to go to secondary school, but this being the first time we would see each other again in several months, felt like an invasion on our relationship. We had a lot of time to make up, and this really wouldn’t allow for that to happen. “I'm sure he’ll be fine,” she attempted to assure me, the other students in our carriage smiled across at me – it was no secret how close me and Viktor were, as twins but as siblings in a wider sense too, we understood each other impeccably in every single way, and had a love for each other that no one could break. Though I dared them to try.

Percy Jackson is not a demigod in this one. Born into the Harry Potter Universe unknowingly apart of the magical world, and far more important than he could ever expect. Can Percy manage to survive the coming war, or even his magical classes?Basically Percy finds out he's the current heir to the House of Black and his great-grandfather, Arcturus, wishes his grand kids were more respectful of his old heart and didn't get into so much trouble. Also, Percy tells people about the future but has no idea that he does.

Sirius had been asked out on a date by some guy from Ravenclaw, Michael, or Matthew or whatever his name was. Remus really couldn’t care less. It really wouldn’t have bothered Remus so much if he hadn’t been pining for the dark haired boy since third year. His little crush only increased after Sirius had come out to him and their other friends back in fourth year, and he had been trying to work up the courage to ask Sirius out himself ever since. He was stupid to think he had plenty of time to do so.

Ever wondered what the events of 'My Immortal' would be like through the eyes of a normal Hogwarts student? 'My Mortal' retells Tara's literary masterpiece through the eyes of Lucy Bonniface, a Slytherin girl in Ebony's dormitory who just wants to get through her final year at Hogwarts smoothly so she can get into the university of her dreams. But that isn't easy when the school is teeming with Mary Sues and bizzare, OOC canon characters having sex in the middle of classrooms all the time.

When Harry Potter irrevocably dragged Draco Malfoy into his life, it was without a warning, and he called him by the wrong name the entire time. To be fair, Draco only realised it was Harry Potter at the same time that Potter realised he wasn’t ‘Liam’, so those two things kind of cancelled each other out. All you had to do was squint.
In hindsight, those weren’t the best conditions. Not that the conditions were really important, because Draco got pulled in no matter which way you wanted to look at it. And here is how it happened.

Sirius had the distinct feeling that the only reason all his friends were sitting in a circle in the middle of the Gryffindor common room at one in the morning playing silly muggle party games was for his sake. Some plan James had come up with in a desperate attempt to cheer him up. It wasn’t working. The only reason Sirius himself was even still sitting there rather than going off to sulk in the dorm was because he did not want to have to explain himself or his depressive mood to the whole group. James, Peter and Remus of course knew the reason behind Sirius’ glum mood, but they had kept it properly under wraps at his request. Sirius definitely didn’t want everyone to know what had happened this summer, how his parents had thrown him out onto the streets, barely breathing. He didn’t want to see the pity in their eyes or for them to look at him as weak or pathetic or anything of the sort. He didn’t want them to know how torn up he really was about it.

Hardly anyone would observe Anjali Kumar and James Potter at school and conclude that they were related in any way. Anjali was the opposite of her extraverted cousin. Well, not quite the opposite, exactly—more like his natural foil, the anti-James, so to speak. Anjali just wants to finish her schooling without any drama so she can become a Magic Naturalist and specialize in Magical Diplomacy. But when adult unicorns go missing in the Forbidden Forest and fairies start turning up dead, it's up to Anjali to figure out what's going on and stop the killings, once and for all.Now, if only she could stop getting distracted by one Sirius Black.(prequel to HP fanfic The Revolutionary!

There were so many things about Scorpius that had always been there, that were beginning to be more apparent to Albus. Like how he looked in glasses, and his rosy-cheeks, and how his eyes shone whenever he laughed. Every time Albus would see his slim fingers carding through the pages of a book, or watch his face relax completely while he cast a spell, he’d get butterflies. And no matter how hard he tried to push them down, to repress his growing feelings, he couldn’t deny it, at least not from himself, any longer. ---Following Albus and Scorpius from fifth year onward, because no, it doesn't all happen in one year.

ἀποκάλυψις - revelation, an unveiling or unfolding of things not previously known, and which could not be known apart from the unveiling. The Ministry falls before Harry’s 17th birthday, and threads of Fate slowly begin to unravel. Hogwarts is barely a pond compared to the ocean that is magic. To learn, to fight, and to protect, the journey to defeat the Dark Lord will stretch far beyond the British Isles. Meanwhile, Voldemort grows with each victory, determined to complete his true mission and bring the muggle world to its knees.Children break their shackles to become more, and gods are forged through magic and blood. A tale of coming-of-age, rebellion, and apocalypse, in a world teetering on the brink of madness.

Slowly Ron uncovers more and more cruelties thrust upon the losing side's families, and the more he sees the harder time he has staying silent. Even if it may cost him greatly in the end.
